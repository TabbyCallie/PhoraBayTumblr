<h3>Character Creation Rules:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>We will be using the Metric system in all the balancing.  This
        was voted by the server, sorry for any difficulties with imperial systems.</li>
    <li>Keep to the format. It makes it easy for everyone else to get the
        information they want to, if it is not formatted correctly you’ll
        be referred back to here until you do.</li>
    <li>Understand that it will all need to be realistic. 8 million
        dollars as a jobless homeless guy isn’t gonna work well. (And
        there’d be a cap way below 8 million.) Black and red eyes for no
        reason, again not going to happen sorry.</li>
    <li>Your character will be copied and pasted as it is, approvers
        aren’t your proofreaders. Any mistakes you make will show up on
        your character page.</li>
    <li>After your character has been approved, copy and paste it again
        with the formatting done correctly inside these [ ` ] fellas, so
        that it is an easy copy and paste onto the reddit. Be sure to get
        help if you do not know how to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the clean template you will just have to add your own `'s to it since
    the formatting won't work otherwise.</p>
<h3>Character Template:</h3>
<p><strong>Name / Alias:</strong> Self-explanatory.<br />

    <strong>Age:</strong> Keep in mind restrictions for age groups, NSFW
    content must be 18+ to abide by all countries laws, try to keep any
    hardcore violence above 15 for viewer sensitivity.<br />

    <strong>Mentality:</strong> What is your character like, personality
    wise. What is their attitude?<br />

    <strong>Affiliation:</strong> Hero, villain, student, mercenary, you
    name it.<br />

    <strong>Description:</strong> Give us an idea of your character, what
    do they look like, what sets them apart? What is their mentality, why
    do they do the things they do?<br />

    <strong>History:</strong> How did they get their power? What do the
    authorities or other groups know about them? What notable events have
    they participated in?<br />

    <strong>Resources:</strong> What assets and how much money do they
    own?<br />

    <strong>Equipment:</strong> Weapons and equipment they carry with
    them, or other stuff they might leave at home.<br />

    <strong>Skills:</strong> Go on, write a list. If they are unique
    skills (for example the knowledge on how to make homemade bombs), you
    might want to include where they got this knowledge.<br />

    <strong>Power:</strong> The most exciting part, what ability does your
    character have? Give us some limits,<br />

    <strong>Versatility:</strong> What are some tricks you have thought
    of for your character to use with your power? Special attacks or uses
    that might not be obvious.<br />

    combat.<br />
