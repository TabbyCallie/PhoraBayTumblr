<p>At the start of the millennium, a lab experiment that went wrong introduced the public to a widespread virus that had broken out of the laboratory. At first, the government had initiated a lockdown, fearful of the consequences that the unknown virus could cause. Once the virus entered the host’s body, many fell into a coma before a breakdown of the body internally due to not being able to survive their cells mutating. The world’s population dropped to a half of what it was, entering into a post-apocalyptic period, the main government unable to hold power, it was whoever had the skill and resources that survived.

The virus responded differently to everybody, the most likely situation is that either, the host dies due to being unable to live with the virus, or it passed through their system fine, their immune system able to keep it at bay. However, there was a rare situation where the body, in fact, mutates, causing different side effects.

In 2007, some survivors of the plague discovered that they had gained ‘powers’. An uprising of people using their powers to kill and steal triggered a group of people rising up and attempting to restore order. During that short amount of time with the world’s population plunged to a half of what it was there were 7/8th of people living normally, and 1/8th of them gained powers, however, due to mass hysteria, many were killed in the brutal struggle for power, resources, and insanity.
After a vicious struggle that lasted three years, the world resembled a sense of order similar to the past. Rebuilding the war-ravaged buildings and laying down new laws, the world settled down again, but there was always a hidden tension, a seemingly thin piece of thread just waiting for the right time to break.

The disease is still around today, people either having a system that is immune to the virus, allowing it to pass without much difficulty or in fact have them develop powers later on in their lives, with the occasional rarity where someone passes away due to this outbreak. It had merely become part of everyone’s daily lives.

Phora Bay is just one of the many successful cities that had sprung up during the rebuilding phrase, full of different entertainment and different communities. It’s up to you to choose where you want to stand.
