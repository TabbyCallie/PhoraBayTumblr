<h3>Server Rules:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Do not be a dick. We’re all here to have fun, and most of the rules
        come down to just being decent to each other.
    </li>
    <li>
        Listen to the hierarchy, it is there for a reason. These people know
        what they’re talking about. While discussion and feedback are
        important, there will always be a final say!
    </li>
    <li>
        Any kind of discrimination won’t be accepted. Yes, that includes
        racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia etc. And for the love of god
        please do not intentionally trigger people.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some roleplay rules:
        <ol>
            <li type="a">
                Do not write for your opponent. You do not know if they have a
                trick up their sleeve against your attack.
            </li>
            <li type="a">
                Do not be attacking someone much weaker than yourself, get OOC
                permission from either staff or the person involved.
            </li>
            <li type="a">
                GM’s have the final say in arguments. If you feel like they’ve
                got something personal against you, take it to admins. Do not
                start a toxic argument, that will not reflect nicely on you.
            </li>
            <li type="a">
                To keep formatting cohesive we will be using:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>Italics for actions and what is happening.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>‘Italics and single quote for thoughts.’</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em><strong>‘Italics, bold and single quotes from
                            counter/secondary thoughts (if necessary)’
                        </strong></em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Quotes for speech.”
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        This server is mainly geared towards non-lethal combat. We do have
        people however that have killed, and will have an order for their
        death, those people are marked as Villains. If they’re known well
        enough, lethal force may be permitted. If you’re unsure ask a GM.
    </li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>As with most servers, any problems with other members should be taken up to
    a staff member, and other issues (including about the staff) to me. If you
    have a problem with me, you can talk to anyone on the team, and keep in
    mind that we won’t be mad at you for expressing constructive feedback, as
    long as it doesn’t turn into excessive bitching about the person.
