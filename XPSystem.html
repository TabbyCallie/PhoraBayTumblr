<h3>XP Rules:</h3>
<p>XP is rewarded for every rp you participate in, anywhere between 10 xp to
    100 xp. 40 is the average because our staff can not count, so it gives you
    more opportunity to do better than worse. When it comes to leveling up, we
    want you to be able to put in consistent work and feel the rewards, but not
    for the rewards to make you trample on everyone else in the server letting
    everyone able to interact with everyone else, so for the most part, the
    buffs will be relatively small. <br />

    Here’s a chart of our xp leveling system:</p>
<p>
    <strong>I</strong> 0-840<br />
    <strong>II</strong> 840-1,680<br />
    <strong>III</strong> 1,680-2,520<br />
    <strong>IV</strong> 2,520-3,360<br />
    <strong>V</strong> 3,360-4,200<br />
    <strong>VI</strong> 4,200-5,040<br />
    <strong>VII</strong> 5,040-5,880<br />
    <strong>VIII</strong> 5,880-6720<br />
    <strong>IX</strong> 6,720-8,400<br />
    <strong>X</strong> 8,400-???
</p>
<p>Another thing we want to do is be completely transparent about how we reward
    rp. Hopefully, that lets us keep it completely nonbias, and lets you guy
    see where your opportunity for improvement in rp lies. Better rp is better
    for everyone?</p>
<p>
    <strong>10XP</strong> - Multiple grammatical and spelling mistakes with
    every reply, sentences did not make sense and it was overall hard to
    understand. Taking time to type out what you mean, then quickly rereading
    after should help clear the vast majority of issues.<br />

    <strong>20XP</strong> - Still hard to understand, there may be a few
    mistakes spread throughout the response but comprehensible if the reader
    were to focus on the response. Another issue may be your character acting
    unrealistic or making decisions completely out of character. Metagaming can
    also cause xp to be lowered vastly.<br />

    <strong>30XP</strong> - Most people can understand what you’re saying, but
    they do not understand why. Your character is likely being a fool and it is
    their actions that are unreasonable. Normal human errors in typing or
    autocorrect failures will not bring you down to 30xp.<br />

    <strong>40XP</strong> - Run-of-the-mill rp, nothing really happened except
    some normal conversations or preperations. The roleplay was solid quality
    and easy to read.<br />

    <strong>50XP</strong> - Pleasant to read, your sentences are constructed
    well and there is only a small amount of mistakes – only so little to be
    easily understood in context.<br />

    <strong>60XP</strong> - Your character probably did something low tier
    noticeable and pulled it off well. Maybe they stopped a villain from
    hurting someone, or you a store! People in the streets start whispering
    your name! Otherwise you’ve shown great depth to the character in a slice
    of life rp and given us some interesting stuff to read about them!<br />

    <strong>70XP</strong> - You just made news on the server! Congratulations,
    you had multiple people invested in what was happening to your character.
    They’ve either made some astounding character development and shown great
    depth, or you’ve pulled off some awesome stunts in roleplay such as
    creative use of your power, finding a new aspect to it, or you did
    something extremely noticeable like rob a bank and got away with it.<br />

    <strong>80XP</strong> - Your character went up against a great risk and
    pulled it off with their own intelligence. Maybe that’s fighting the serial
    killer you crossed in the street and winning, or fooling the heroes with
    your own escape – or even better, defeating them and showing them who’s
    boss!<br />

    <strong>90XP</strong> - Climbing high, your character went against high
    risk yet again and showed some great character depth and/or development.
    The fight wasn’t just tense for the violence, but their internal monologues
    and thoughts were keeping us on edge as well. Fantastic realism,
    development, and creativity shown throughout the entire roleplay.<br />

    <strong>100XP</strong> - The big one, almost exclusively reserved for major
    events. You were a roleplaying god and we were all on the edge of our seat
    to see what happens next. do not feel bummed if you do not get 100xp, it
    has to be truly a work of art.
