<p class="villain"><strong>History:</strong> An uneventful youth, Ryu always
    trouble empathising with others. All he felt was greed and envy when he
    looked at another kid's toys.<br/>

    But I'm sure he's grown out of his psycho phase.</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Resources:</strong> Student Loan</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Pocket knife, water pistol,
    portable battery</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Skills:</strong>Cleaning, lying, juggling</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Power:</strong> Tropic Thunder<br/>

    Ryu can generate and store lightning within his body- up to 0.075 amps! He
    can shoot this out like lightning, up to 50m of blue lightningbolts. He
    recharges 0.025 amps a turn, but can absorb electricity from other power
    sources: Even lightning striking him itself! <br/>

    If 0.1 amps strike a body part, it causes serious pain, and paralyses the
    limb for 2 turns. Ryu can control the amps used in each 'shot'.<br/>

    Lightning supercharges his brain, giving him 0.20s reaction time<br/>

    As an aesthetic effect, stormclouds generate when he uses his power;
    thunder rumbling in the background, and rain pitter-pattering down.</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Versatility:</strong> He can use his lightning to
    recharge a cellphone!</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Demo:</strong> A bad guy swings his club at Ryu's
    head. Ryu ducks, and tases him; saving the day.</p>
