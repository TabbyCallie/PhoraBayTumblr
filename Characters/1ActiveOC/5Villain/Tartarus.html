<h1 class="villain">Tartarus</h1>

<p class="villain"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Moriarty Ivans/Tartarus</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Mentality:</strong> He is often perceived as a
    playful and shy person, someone you can go to for help or if you just want
    a friendly person to speak to. A well-versed manipulator and with a silver
    tongue. However, his true self is sly, cunning and flirty, with no care for
    rules, sadistic and a psychopath. </p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Consigliere to ‘the Don’,
    Mafia, Villain.</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Description:</strong> He is quite the ordinary
    looking person, brown hair and innocent looking brown eyes. A soft smile
    and shining bright brown eyes what normal people receive when they meet
    him, his normality and gentle ways making him easily blending into the
    background. Although he appears to be a naive young man, there was
    sometimes a hint of something more, something alluring, a hint of mystery
    within him. Affiliated with the mafia, not many get to see him, and live to
    remember. Being in the mafia, his more sadistic side is shown, using all
    his assets to do whatever the job is needed. His job at the bar letting him
    use his more flirty and playful side under a disguise, whilst getting the
    money he needs.</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>History:</strong> Ever since he was young, he had
    it ingrained in him that he was a disappointment, due to the fact that his
    power did not appear at the same age as others. Beaten and verbally abused
    by his father, he was used to covering up his injuries, perfecting his
    facade. His father was a gambler and an alcoholic, gone for long nights and
    coming back to abuse him. His mother, busy with her jobs and unable to look
    after Moriarty. To the public eye, they were the perfect family, a nice
    child, beautiful mother and a financially secure father. But they did teach
    him some valuable lessons. One, appearances are deceiving, two, how to act
    and pretend and three, how to control the anger and hate inside of him into
    a weapon. <br/>

    At the young age of 9, his father was drunk in a stupid stupor, his mother
    watching some boring tv drama before the back door was broken in, a group
    of 5 men dressed in black barging in and swarming over towards his parents,
    Moriarty watching the incident with a sense of morbid curiosity, seeing
    them get what they deserve. Every blood spilt that stained the ground a
    macabre site, yet it seemed to awaken something deep inside of him, an
    instinctive action that makes him walk out of his hiding spot to stand in
    front of the apparent leader of the group, standing in the very life force
    of the man he called a ‘father’.<br/>

    A small pang of perhaps sadness slid through his black heart before he
    crushed down on it, instead, kneeling by the leader, a bitter smile on his
    face as he stared at the barrel of the gun aimed at his forehead, his body
    littered with bandages and obvious signs of abuse. Perhaps there was
    something in his eyes, a shadow of a thought gleaming through his chocolate
    eyes, but they stopped. Pulling him up by his hand, the leader took him
    back to the base where he was brought up since, using the skills that he
    earned and the harsh training he threw his all into to slowly move up the
    ranks, forming a comradeship with the Don’s son [current mafia leader]
    . <br/>

    Currently, he lives in a cozy apartment with his black cat, Nyx, living a
    comfortable lifestyle as he works as a bartender whilst attending the
    university in the city. </p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Resources:</strong> £70,000 some from his
    bartender job and from his...less legal means. Also, a few other identities
    that he uses with their own bank account and safehouses.</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Twin combat knives that are
    always on him and a crossbow, a black car and a motorbike</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Power:</strong> Tenebris</br>
    The hate and anger inside of him was a deadly weapon, condensing and
    sharpening the darkness inside of him, and their fellow demons. Able to
    manipulate the shadows and dark energy in whatever way he wishes in a
    20-meter radius, he can form weapons and armor as he wishes, projectiles
    traveling at a speed of 35m/s and having a durability of 15kN. The impact
    force being 10kN and the shadow about to support a weight of 200kg. As long
    as there is some sort of shadow, he is able to use it for whatever he
    wishes, a killer without a trace.<br/>

    Using the darkness, he is also able to control the energy to heal himself
    and others. For small wounds, he is able to heal them in 4 turns. After he
    heals a wound, he is unable to use it again until a 6 turn cooldown. He
    also cannot heal the same place two times in a row, but he can heal another
    area before going back to the same area. (e.g: forearm, head,
    forearm)<br/>

    The dark energy is also able to be condensed and compacted to release a
    beam with a 1.5m wide diameter at a speed of 40m/s. The attack has a base
    damage of 15kN, but he can continue charging for two turns, releasing a
    beam of 20kN. The beam has a range of 40m before fading away. After
    releasing the beam, it requires a 3 turn cooldown, however, if he charges
    it for 2 turns, it requires a 5 turn cooldown.  If he gets interrupted, it
    goes on a one-turn cooldown before adding on the normal charge
    rates. <br/>

    The shadows can collect information for the user in a 50m radius, as long
    as they’re close enough. It requires a lot of his concentration and can
    give him a headache if he does it for too long. <br/>

    If his armor breaks 3 times, it requires a turn for creation, adding on an
    extra turn everytime it breaks after this point. <br/>

    If he makes projectiles/weapons for 30 mins, he will get exhausted, the
    speed dropping by 10m/s.<br/>

    He can perform 4 blasts before the speed of the blast drops by 5m/s</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Versatility:</strong> Due to his darkness power,
    he is skilled at infiltration, the shadows able to muffle his footsteps and
    healing him blend into the background. Energy attacks by him are unable to
    be affected by TK due to the fact that it is not a material object. He is
    also able to use his power to propel him from places, using the shadow to
    support and aid him, his gymnastic side helping him.</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Demo:</strong> A group of thugs came up to him,
    using the shadows of the alleyway, he creates two swords, fending them
    off.</p>
