<p class="villain"><strong>Description:</strong> Wears a black

<p class="villain"><strong>History:</strong> Jack was born into a
    family that didn't want him. The chaos of the world falling into
    ruin was a perfect excuse for shutting him away. When you were
    only four years old he was sequestered away in an old fallout
    bunker. His parents brought him food every few days. He didn't
    see them. They told him was too dangerous for him to come out.
    He obeyed, terrified of what was going on above. His parents
    would tell horror stories of the outside world over the intercom
    they used to communicate. He hadn't physically seen them in over
    ten years when the food stopped coming. He went a week with no
    food and barely any water when he finally made the choice to
    leave the bunker. His parents were nowhere to be seen. He took
    as much food from the house as he could and waited. It didn't
    take long to find out that everything they had told him was a
    lie. They said people had become cannibals and nukes had made
    the sky burn your flesh during the day. They had lied about
    everything as part of some sick joke. It was nine days from
    leaving the bunker that they came back. He would have died if he
    had stayed in the bunker. Filled with rage and betrayal he hid
    and killed them in their sleep. He killed them with his trusty
    old knife. He'd had it his entire life and now it was getting
    bigger. He liked the way it felt in his hand. Each kill made it
    better. He had found a purpose.</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Resources:</strong> None beyond his
    equipment. He lives in gutters and boxes.</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Equipment:</strong> His costume. Three
    long knives are hidden throughout his costume. His power
    generated sword.</p>

    basic self-defense skills, and highly adept at stealth. A decent
    driver as well.</p>

<p class="villain"><strong>Power:</strong> Death Knell gets a charge
    everytime someone dies within 1.609344 kilometers. He can hold
    up to 22 charges. Charges degrade one at a time after a period
    of eight hours. For each charge, his sword increases in size and
    weight.<br/>

    Can change sword length at will from a small dagger to a full
    shortsword. The strength of iron.<br/>

    Kills make the sword longer and add durability up to 20kN.<br/>

    Can teleport the blade to him using 1 charge, takes 1 turn.<br/>

    If the blade is broken it takes 5 charges to repair it and takes
    1 turn.<br/>

    He treats the weight of the blade as being half as much as it
    actually is.<br/>

    Blade length is capped at 220 cm. The blade starts at 40 cm and
    each charge increases the length by 20 cm. This is ultra
    greatsword length and naturally weighs 204 kg so half that is
