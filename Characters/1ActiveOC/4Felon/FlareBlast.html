<p class="felon"><strong>History:</strong> Amy was a
    sheltered child, to say the least. Her family controlling
    basically every aspect of her life. Of course, like a good
    little girl, she obeyed without question to their every
    whim. Learning what they wanted her to learn. Practicing
    the skills they told her to. There was no freedom. But how
    could she know something she had never experienced?<br/>

    That is, until her 15th birthday. Where, as a celebration
    of sorts, her family had taken her out to camp. As they
    were just finishing, packing their things to leave the
    sight, Amy got a spark. A sudden sensation. A thought that
    held so much weight that she mindlessly wandered away from
    her unsuspecting family. Them having made clear orders for
    her to stay put, and not even thinking she would disobey.
    <br/>

    It was dark out. The only light she would have as she moved
    throughout the forest a shiny moon in the sky. But that
    only did so much. No parents in sight. No one giving her a
    command.  No more rules. For the first time in her
    life…true freedom. She smiled. A genuine smile, one that
    would soon turn into a small smirk.<br/>

    She started to walk faster, and faster. Then she would jog,
    and finally, she burst out in a full-on sprint! Running
    throughout the woods with reckless glee! The wind in her
    hair as she laughed in joy! That is until she heard it. She
    heard them. Her family. They had come looking for her.
    Their voices loud and commanding, always loud and
    commanding. She stopped dead in her tracks, her head
    turning towards their voices. She almost went to them on
    instinct alone. Almost.<br/>

    She was different now. She had, had her first actual taste
    of freedom. And Amy wasn’t giving it up. Her mind was made,
    and her family wasn’t ever gonna get their ‘precious’ girl
    back now.<br/>

    And that’s when it happened. She hadn’t noticed at first,
    mind still being filled with all these new emotions.
    Emotions she had never knew existed. Joy, fear,
    desperation…rage.<br/>

    Without her knowledge, her entire body burst out in flames.
    Her skin now molten rock and her once red hair now a fierce
    storm of fire. She narrowed her eyes in the direction of
    her family, unconsciously raising her hands. And as if on
    instinct, she let out a torrent of flame!<br/>

    The entire forest was burned to the ground that night. No
    casualties, only a missing person. Amy Williams was
    pronounced dead only a few days later. Her body never being
    found, but no one would ever believe that she could survive
    such a ferocious firestorm.<br/>

    How wrong they all were.<br/>

    She escaped, finally free from her family and their hideous
    influence. She then spent the next nine years of her life
    using her power. She used them to steal food and new
    clothing, maaaaybe taking a few hundred bills with her on
    her way.<br/>

    She now goes about doing whatever she pleases for cheap
    thrills, a cocky and childish attitude about her.
    Occasionally getting into fights with the local heroes,
    always just managing to get away before the coppers could
    show up.</p>

<p class="felon"><strong>Resources:</strong> An
    abandoned warehouse she calls home, decorated with all her
    stolen items and pics of both her wins and losses to
    heroes. Along with a few stuffed dummies she uses as target
    practice every now and then.</p>

<p class="felon"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Fire
    resistant suit underneath her regular clothing.</p>

<p class="felon"><strong>Skills:</strong> Has an
    understanding of self-defense martial arts, marksmanship
    with her flames, a little stronger than the everyday human
    due to her activities, and while her powers may not show
    it, she can be sneaky when she wants to be.</p>

<p class="felon"><strong>Power:</strong> Fire
    Transformation/Manipulation.<br/>

    While normal, fire has no effect on Amy at all. Maybe the
    smoke, but the fire itself is harmless to her. She cannot
    manipulate or generate any fire while normal.<br/>

    However, when she actually does use her Magma Form, she is
    then able to generate and slightly manipulate fire of
    around 450c. Only able to send off one wave of fire from
    the palms of her hands per turn. And her manipulation only
    goes so far as too change the size of the said fire. The
    fire’s speed is around 40mph, losing 10c for every 5 meters
    away from the flame travels.<br/>

    Amy can condense the flame into a small ball, and upon
    collision with an object, the ball will explode in a
    four-meter radius with a knockback damage of 8kN. The balls
    can only be used once, with a cooldown of four turns. She
    can also fire off a concussive wave of fire from her hands,
    able to deal 11kN plus the heat of her fire. She can use
    her fire waves to propel herself into the air, using them
    as small thrusters to move around the area at a speed of
    30mph.</p>

<p class="felon"><strong>Versatility:</strong> Able to
    use her heat to weld weaker metals together, and to roast
    her up a pretty mean s'more.</p>

<p class="felon"><strong>Demo:</strong> Amy smirked,
    letting the flames consume her form as ravenous eyes stared
    at her opponents.<br/>

    “It’s just not your lucky day fella!” And with that plus
    her transformation complete, she gave a loud laugh and
    stuck her right out! A blast of fire was sent spiraling
    towards her opponent!<br/>

    And that was that.</p>
