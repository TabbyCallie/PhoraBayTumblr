<h1 style="color:#f37;">Orchestra</h1>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Lyon
    Johannes/Orchestra</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Age:</strong> 30</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Lyon is a man of
    class, he has a flair for the dramatic both as himself and his
    villainous persona, scheming and manipulating people with his
    incredible aptitude for lies and deceit. He's cocky, too cocky.
    Delusional, convinced that he's destined for greatness and that
    he's above most average people. These are all acts, this famous
    celebrity has been corrupted long ago, and deep down: He's
    nothing but a pathetic sad wreck of a fool who craves love and
    attention.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Felon</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Description:</strong> Lyon's true
    face is rarely seen, to keep paparazzi away he almost always
    wears some form of disguise. Wigs, contact lenses, matching
    outfits, voice changers, many vehicles etc. He's an excellent
    actor and can pull off a variety of people, even females...
    mostly females actually, don't ask him why. But when you do see
    his true face, he has snow-white hair of the same color as his
    webs and red eyes of the same color as a spider. He took some
    self-defense classes and got abs too look more appealing and
    better defend himself, so he's stronger than he seems In that
    classy expansive suit of his.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>History:</strong> Lyon grew up in a
    rich family of 5, an older sister and brother. His father was a
    famous musician and his mother a famous songwriter, they both
    traveled the world in-between having kids and raising them. Due
    too his parents their social status Lyon could almost never go
    out, and they both made him go through extensive musical
    practice. He loved music, he loved playing and performing,
    showing off how good he was too people and basking in the
    spotlight, but his siblings didn't feel that way. His sister
    Lyra often teased him for being so reliant on his parents and
    never having to take responsibility for his actions. His brother
    Leron also caused him grief, Lyon was a cheerful boy, he didn't
    hurt a fly and just wanted to make his parents proud, Leron
    despised that outlook and often took Lyon with him too criminal
    activities, to make him "man up" as his older brother would say.
    All of this made Lyon become corrupted, he started lying and
    taking advantage of people’s emotional states too get his way
    and avoid consequences, he acquired 5 of the 7 sins of man. He
    became prideful of his accomplishments to the point of seeing no
    flaws within himself. He became greedy and wanted it all, fame,
    money, women (and men), attention. He lusted for all of these
    desires that bloomed inside of him. He envied his parents for
    how easy their lives seemed while he was isolated, like a
    prison. He felt wrath towards his sister, angry at her for the
    suffering she made him endure throughout his childhood. In truth
    each of these family members never had ill intent toward
    another, they always wanted to do the best for each other, but
    their methods had consequences. <br />

    Those being the Johannes Incident. Each family member expects
    for Lyon was killed, the culprit never found. It was a
    wide-scale media event that Lyon had instigated, he couldn’t
    bear to continue living the way he did. So he made them
    disappear, and used the quick spread of the news as a means of
    kickstarting his career, making a sympathetic impression on the
    public and rising to fame like no other musician ever before.
    Each day he’s tormented by his actions, deep down he wishes he
    didn’t have to do what he did, but it’s too late now: He’s the
    only Johannes left, so he’s going to honor them by being the
    best goddamn Johannes the world will ever see. The public knows
    Lyon as a world-wide famous musician with a tragic past, one who
    pushes for innovation and a unique bold style of music, often
    using strange combinations of instruments, song tempos etc. The
    public does not know of Orchestra yet, he prefers to hide in the
    shadows and scheme, preparing for his big debut while doing
    smaller crimes in one-off disguises. His debut will be glorious,
    after all: Lyon Johannes always gets his way.</p>
