<h1 style="color:#93f;">Envoy</h1>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Bronte Williams/Envoy</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Mentality:</strong> A tactical mind even in
    social encounters, sometimes overthinking tiny details but also ready to
    cut through the bullshit and get down to the matter at hand. She dislikes
    posturing and peacocking, and she bucks against authority that she doesn't
    respect. She's looking for a worthy cause to get behind, knowing she's got
    a unique skill to offer.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Rogue</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Description:</strong> A tall and well
    proportioned young woman, Bronte has thick wavy hair that she flat irons so
    that it flows down her back instead of poofing up around her head. She's
    fit with some junk in the trunk, but a normal healthy weight. Her nose is
    very small, and her cheekbones are soft. She doesn't have dimples.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>History:</strong> During high school, she was
    awesome at math and everyone thought she'd be an engineer. She took an
    electronics course and went about it her own way after that. However, after
    high school, a mysterious benefactor sets her up in a fancy apartment and
    gives her a job delivering mail and laundry to other random places around
    the city for exorbitant sums. All the places were always new or just
    renovated, with no signs of occupancy.<br />

    She was too curious, and soon enough she was gagged, bound, and thrown in a
    trunk.<br />

    The desert was cold at night and the sand was rough, she learned these two
    things as she was dragged over some rocks and towards some other flatter
    rocks. She got a kick in her head for trying to look around, and her eye
    was quickly swelling shut. She was shot twice in the back and left to fall
    into a deep pit, but as soon as she started falling, she was caught. She
    didn't know who or what, and she lost consciousness. An hour later, she
    startles herself awake, lying in a hospital ER room with a damn nurse
    trying to put a catheter in. As soon as she could, she makes a break for
    it, escaping after stealing some scrubs to change into.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Resources:</strong> $50k, she's good at money
    laundering and being the middle woman when brokering deals, so she's got a
    little nest egg of commission built up. She doesn't really own much,
    preferring for her employers to furnish lodging and transportation if it's
    required.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Her suit (10 kN) has armor
    plates on her torso and limbs that are sharp-edged, and kevlar fabric under
    that and on everything else. She carries a big shield. She also carries a
    backpack with 16 m rope, a flare, and a liter of water.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Skills:</strong> She likes working with her
    hands, she knows about electrical work and can rewire most electronics if
    need be, she is a proficient welder. Also her nimble fingers are adept at
    larceny as well. She also has a beautiful singing voice, many would
    say.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Power:</strong> Power: Dimension
    Manipulation.<br />

    This lets her have extra storage space and extra copies of herself from
    other dimensions.<br />

    <u>“Hammerspace”</u>: Envoy can store up to 200 kg of mass inside
    extradimensional space. A portal is created and things passing through it
    will end up in the hammerspace. Living things that are willing can enter
    the hammerspace, provided there's room inside for them and it wouldn't be
    fatal. When she recalls something, it appears touching her in some way,
    usually in her hand. She is very selective and precise when recalling
    something, but only to a certain extent. She couldn't just pull all the
    oxygen out of the hammerspace, but she could put a haystack with a needle
    inside the hammerspace and immediately produce the needle. Even if there's
    nothing specific in the hammerspace, Envoy keeps it filled with 21°C, 50%
    humidity normal air from her apartment. When her reflections bring
    equipment from the Hammerspace, it appears back in the hammerspace if it
    gets more than 5 m from the reflection. Any kind of bomb will become a dud
    if removed from the hammerspace by a reflection. If the reflections both
    open the Hammerspace, then Envoy may pass through like a teleport.<br />

    <u>“Copies”</u>: Envoy can summon up to 2 copies of herself from other
    dimensions. They just seem to condense from the air, and afterward can move
    on their own. They carry the same equipment as Envoy, but the items are not
    permanent. When they are dismissed voluntarily or killed, they just
    disappear without a sound, along with their equipment. Envoy and her copies
    rely on normal means of conversation; no telepathy or hivemind type
    shenanigans. Copies cannot copy themselves. They last 2 hours. They cannot
    “clone” equipment.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Versatility:</strong> Extreme, what a
    teammate! Usually has the tools to get the job done and plenty of hands for
    those tools because she's a trio by herself.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Demo:</strong> As quickly as the thug raises his
    knife, a portal interjects itself between Envoy and the crazy person.
    Unwilling to enter it, the thug tries to dodge to the side of the portal,
    knife raised again to stab.<br />

    A copy of Envoy from another dimension grabs his arm mid stab as she darts
    out of the portal. With the pointy bit out of her face, Envoy raises her
    shield and shield bashes the thug right in the teeth. Her copy drags him
    over backwards, and then she pins his knife wielding hand to the ground
    under her knee.<br />

    Envoy's boot sinks deep into his groin as he tries to struggle to get
    control of the knife. The first portal closes and another opens up over the
    thug. He is given little time to react as a second copy drops down onto his
    chest, feet first.</p>
