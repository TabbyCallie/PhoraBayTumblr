<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Jeanne Wyrmwood/Rift</p>


<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Age:</strong> 24</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Rather prideful and full of
    herself. Acts like people should be homered that they are allowed to work
    with her. <br />

    Due to her upbringing she is rather sadistic, stern and cold. Cutting her
    losses is second nature to her and it is quite hard to make her actually
    care about someone. She trusts no one outside of her own family and gains
    great pleasure from denouncing other's their ideals, preferably while
    toying with them in combat.</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Mercenary (Rogue)</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Description:</strong> Pale skinned with piercing
    gold eyes and multiple scars she likes to hide. Her gold eyes always look
    like those of a hunter stalking its prey, cold and ready to react at any
    second.</p>

    The user can create tears in space that allow the user to step into them
    and appear anywhere they can see or know well.<br />

    <u>Acceleration portal</u>: The user can once per turn create a portal that
    can only transport willing people to any location she can see. The user
    will also be able to influence the person's speed to kill all of their
    momenta. This portal can only stay open for 1 turn and can be closed
    instantaneously. If anyone would be stuck in it during the closing they
    will just end up unharmed at the end position. She can't open portals in a
    3-meter radius of unwilling targets. Cooldown 1 turn. This portal is
    created by her running her hand or blade vertically through the air which
    takes 0.5 seconds and them becoming active also takes 0.5 seconds. <br />

    <u>Riftblade</u>: the user can create a tiny acceleration portal when they
    swing their blade to double the swing speed and increase it's cutting force
    to 11 kN once per turn. This takes 1 second of buildup in during which the
    blade will shine with a purplish dark light. She can also charge the attack
    for 4 turns to make the next attack deal 16kN of damage.<br />

    <u>Retrieval</u>: Makes up to 3 small portals to retrieve up to 3 items
    that she touched in the last 3 turns. It takes .5 seconds for the portal to
    open and 0.5 seconds for it to become active. If the item hasn't been
    touched in the last 3 turns then she can only make 1 portal and it will
    take double the time to open and become active. This portal won't work if
    someone is holding the item she tries to retrieve or if it is attached to
    something. Cooldown 2 turns.<br />

    All Portals start of an as a 2.5-meter long 'crack' in space that emits a
    purple glow before suddenly growing into an oval of 2.5-meters long and
    1-meter wide. She can create her portals anywhere she can see as long as it
    is within a 50-meter radius.</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Versatility:</strong> This ability allows her for
    great mobility and supporting capabilities by evacuating allies.</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Demo:</strong> Rift user her portal to get close
    to an enemy before trying to overwelm them with her superior speed and
    strength. If she fails to finish her target quick she will use another
    portal to escape.</p>
