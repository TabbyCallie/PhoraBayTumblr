    evil this man can be.</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>History:</strong> Born as the younger son of
    the King of a minuscule European Kingdom, he had always
    hoped to succeed his elder brother and one day take the throne.
    They were both trained in what was expected of royalty, both of
    them smart, however, his elder brother always surpassed
    him.<br />

    But he had one flaw... he was too kind, too trusting, too
    defenseless. One day, fed up with everyone around him treating
    him like he was inferior to his elder brother, he set in motion
    his plan to assassinate his elder brother. Unfortunately, the
    guards were too well trained for Vali to succeed. When the King
    heard of this, he exiled Vali from the kingdom, covering up the
    incident to save face for the royal family.<br />

    Vali was forced to go away to another city far away, allowed to
    come back only when he had matured into a fine young man, worthy
    of being praised as a member of the Royal Family.<br />

    The quickest way? It was the become a hero and commit good
    deeds, just so he could improve his image, and pretend to see
    the error of his ways.</p>


<p class="hero"><strong>Resources:</strong> Hero's Income.
    Some maintenance money from his family when needed to sustain
   his lifestyle.</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>Equipment:</strong> The weapons he
    summons.</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>Skills:</strong> Well-versed in
    playing the piano. Learned Martial Arts as part of being a part
    of the Royal Family, highly physically trained, as a way of
    surpassing his brother.</p>

<p class="hero">
    <strong>Power:</strong> Weapons Summoning<br />

    The user summons weapons that only he can use. He can at max
    have 1 weapon out at the same time and it takes 10 seconds to
    shift between weapons. He can't shift weapons again the turn
    after he shifted or that same turn.<br />

    <u>Shield</u>: A 1.5x1.5m great shield that can move at 10m/s
    and can withstand up to 10kN of attacks (armor). The shield can
    be moved by the user's mind. It cannot lift anything, but he can
    sustain at least 90 KGs without lowering altitude. It has a
    range of 10 meters, after which the telepathic link fails.<br />

    The user can turn the shield into a barrier (blue barrier for
    good, red for evil) of max 25m^3. That can withstand up to 15kN
    before shattering. The barrier cannot be moved. The barrier is
    limited to basic shapes. The barrier can be cast within 10
    meters radius of the shield.<br />

    The shield can be transformed into a suit of armor (6kN) which
    allows flight at 3 m/s. This can be used to make it effectively
    weightless, allowing Vali to not tire out as much.<br />

    If the barrier breaks the weapon will fade away, taking 2 turns
    to be summoned. In normal form, the shield can be pierced
    without fading.<br />

    <u>4-swords</u>: Summons a set of four one-handed swords and
    causes the user will grow 2 temporary hands that will also fade
    away when the swords fade away. These arms cannot be used to
    interact with anything other than the swords. The swords add 3kN
    cutting and 2kN punching strength.<br />

    <u>Staff</u>: The user will stun any limbs that the staff slams
    into for 2 turns and if it hit's someone's torso it will be able
    to half their speed for 1 turn. If the user hits them once more
    on the torso after that the opponent will be stunned for 1 turn.
    The hit of the staff also pushes people 2 meters back. The staff
    doesn't stun the user.<br />

    <u>Mask</u>: Vali can choose to don a blue mask on his face,
    although he doesn't do it, seeing as he's hiding it, for when he
    needs it the most. Unlike the other weapons, Vali can keep this
    summoned along with his other summons, without needing to
    de-summon other summons.</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>Versatility:</strong> Currently quite
    versatile in all forms of combat, as well as having a defensive
    aspect to his quirk. Unfortunately, there's not much utilitarian
    uses to his quirk, thus he is mainly combat and front-line
    focussed.</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>Demo:</strong><em>Vali was filing
    paperwork for the recent case of the collapsing building.</em>
    <br />

    <em>Suddenly his phone notified him of a new emergency, as he
        got up, unsummoned his swords, then opened the window.</em>
        <br />

    "Good day for surfing, isn't it?" <em>He chuckled, as he jumped
        out, summoninghis shield below him, surfing on it towards
        the scene of the commotion.</em></p>
