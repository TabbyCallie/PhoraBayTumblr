<h1 class="vigilante">Crusader</h1>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Crusader (Self
    Proclaimed) The Roach Knight (As known by others)</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Age:</strong> 32</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Mentality:</strong> The original body
    of Crusader is actually agnostic. It’s counterintuitive, but he
    knows that making his clones think they are going on a religious
    crusade motivates them.<br/>

    Generation 2 clones are rather daft and believe they are
    retaking the holy land.<br/>

    Generation 3 clones are mindless.<br/>

    Fire will send him running in fear, fuck fire.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Vigilante</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Description:</strong> He wears a dirty
    knight costume when he is in his vigilante form. His face gets
    slightly distorted at every regeneration, and he can’t
    regenerate hair, so he’s always bald.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>History:</strong> No one really knows.
    Perhaps he has some dark tragic backstory that screwed with his
    mind, but for now he’s just known as the village idiot. He isn’t
    the brightest tool in the shed, due to his quirk not being able
    to fully regenerate a capable brain.<br/>

    At one point, he was a rich man, but he spent his entire savings
    on suits of armor. 250 to be exact.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Resources:</strong> He has 250 suits of
    armor and longswords stashed in some pit.<br/>

    He also has a pet rabbit.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Crude Medieval
    style armor that resists 5kN and a longsword. That’s it.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Skills:</strong> Swordsmanship.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Power:</strong> Planaria Physiology.
    No. Really.<br/>

    His body is made up of modified stem cells, just like planaria.
    This means he can regenerate even after being utterly
    mutilated.</p>
<ul class="vigilante">
    <li>One body of Crusader can only clone 5 times, and with every
        generation from the original (Recreating the brain), his
        mind gets weaker. Generation 3 clones can’t clone
        themselves, they need the brain to regenerate.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Gen 1 (Original)</u>: Functions as a capable human,
            maybe not the brightest human, but he is accepted as an
            intelligent life form.</li>
        <li><u>Gen 2</u>: A piece of flesh from the original body
            that has to reform a brain creates a weaker brain. These
            clones are mostly instinctual, they can communicate but
            they are horrible for conversation. They will constantly
            talk like they are a crusader for some reason.</li>
        <li><u>Gen 3</u>: Flies have higher capabilities than a
            clone from a clone. These clones are capable of charging
            into battle and screaming simple battle cries, not much
            else. They can’t maneuver in combat, they simply try to
            hit their opponent with as much force as they can. They
            fail to communicate beyond meaningless babble.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Another drawback is his bone structure. His bones are weaker
        with every generation because stem cells can’t create normal
        bones, they use a bad mimicry of bones.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Gen 1: 4kN</li>
        <li>Gen 2: 3kN</li>
        <li>Gen 3: 2kN, 1kN for joints</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p class="vigilante">Generation 2 and 3 clones have 2 days after
    forming before their brain gives out and they died.<br/>

    Generation 3 clones can’t dodge attacks, and almost every
    successful attack incapacitates them.<br/>

    Their mind breaks if they exit 200 meters from around the
    original.<br/>

    He can at most only have 25 clones out at once, 1 Generation 1,
    5 Generation 2, 20 Generation 3.<br/>

    <u>Regeneration table</u>:</p>
<ul class="vigilante">
    <li>Small wounds: 2 hours</li>
    <li>Large wounds: 8 hours</li>
    <li>1/5th of the body: 12 hours</li>
    <li>2/5th of the body: 16 hours</li>
    <li>3/5th of the body: 20 hours</li>
    <li>4/5th of body+ (Requires a limb up to the elbow or knee at
        least): 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<p class="vigilante">
    Another effect of his planarian physiology is that he doesn’t
    rely on vitals in combat. Other than his brain, damage to his
    vital organs don’t do anything. He can survive a spear through
    the heart.<br/>

    Generations 2 and 3 clones don’t feel pain.<br/>

    Brainless limbs still have muscle movement, but they have the
    intelligence of real-life planaria. This means they serve no
    real purpose except being creepy.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Versatility:</strong> His regeneration
    is too slow to be applicable in fights, but his survivability
    lets him continue to fight even with entire limbs cut off or his
    heart stabbed.</p>

<p class="vigilante">He hides in his little hideout. He makes 4
    clones, all with reduced intelligence and combat ability, and
    they go out and should try to fulfill a quest. Deus Vult!</p>
