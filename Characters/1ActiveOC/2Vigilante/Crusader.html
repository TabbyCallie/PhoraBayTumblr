<h1 style="color:#66f;">Crusader</h1>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Crusader (Self Proclaimed)
    The Roach Knight (As known by others)</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Age:</strong> 32</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Mentality:</strong> The original body of Crusader
    is actually agnostic. It’s counterintuitive, but he knows that making his
    clones think they are going on a religious crusade motivates them. <br />

    Generation 2 clones are rather daft and believe they are retaking the holy
    land.<br />

    Generation 3 clones are mindless.<br />

    Fire will send him running in fear, fuck fire.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Vigilante</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Description:</strong> He wears a dirty knight
    costume when he is in his vigilante form. His face gets slightly distorted
    at every regeneration, and he can’t regenerate hair, so he’s always
    bald.</p>

<p style="color: #66f; text-align: center;">Combat Form</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>History:</strong> No one really knows. Perhaps he
    has some dark tragic backstory that screwed with his mind, but for now he’s
    just known as the village idiot. He isn’t the brightest tool in the shed,
    due to his quirk not being able to fully regenerate a capable brain.<br />

    At one point, he was a rich man, but he spent his entire savings on suits
    of armor. 250 to be exact.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Resources:</strong> He has 250 suits of armor and
    longswords stashed in some pit.<br />

    He also has a pet rabbit.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Crude Medieval style armor
    that resists 5kN and a longsword. That’s it.</p>

    <p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Skills:</strong> Swordsmanship.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Power:</strong> Planaria Physiology. No.
    Really.<br />

    His body is made up of modified stem cells, just like planaria. This means
    he can regenerate even after being utterly mutilated.<br />

    One body of Crusader can only clone 5 times, and with every generation from
    the original (Recreating the brain), his mind gets weaker. Generation 3
    clones can’t clone themselves, they need the brain to regenerate.<br />

    <u>Gen 1 (Original)</u>: Functions as a capable human, maybe not the
    brightest
    human, but he is accepted as an intelligent life form.<br />

    <u>Gen 2</u>: A piece of flesh from the original body that has to reform a
    brain creates a weaker brain. These clones are mostly instinctual, they can
    communicate but they are horrible for conversation. They will constantly
    talk like they are a crusader for some reason.<br />

    <u>Gen 3</u>: Flies have higher capabilities than a clone from a clone.
    These clones are capable of charging into battle and screaming simple
    battle cries, not much else. They can’t maneuver in combat, they simply try
    to hit their opponent with as much force as they can. They fail to
    communicate beyond meaningless babble.<br />

    Another drawback is his bone structure. His bones are weaker with every
    generation because stem cells can’t create normal bones, they use a bad
    mimicry of bones.<br />

    <u>Simplified physics</u>:</p>
<ul style="color:#66f;">
    <li>Gen 1: 4kN</li>
    <li>Gen 2: 3kN</li>
    <li>Gen 3: 2kN, 1kN for joints</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#66f;">
    Generation 2 and 3 clones have 2 days after forming before their brain
    gives out and they died.<br />

    Generation 3 clones can’t dodge attacks, and almost every successful attack
    incapacitates them.<br />

    Their mind breaks if they exit 200 meters from around the original.<br />

    He can at most only have 25 clones out at once, 1 Generation 1, 5
    Generation 2, 20 Generation 3.<br />

    <u>Regeneration table</u>:</p>
<ul style="color:#66f;">
    <li>Small wounds: 2 hours</li>
    <li>Large wounds: 8 hours</li>
    <li>1/5th of the body: 12 hours</li>
    <li>2/5th of the body: 16 hours</li>
    <li>3/5th of the body: 20 hours</li>
    <li>4/5th of body+ (Requires a limb up to the elbow or knee at least): 24
        hours</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#66f;">
    Another effect of his planarian physiology is that he doesn’t rely on
    vitals in combat. Other than his brain, damage to his vital organs don’t do
    anything. He can survive a spear through the heart.<br />

    Generations 2 and 3 clones don’t feel pain.<br />

    Brainless limbs still have muscle movement, but they have the intelligence
    of real-life planaria. This means they serve no real purpose except being
    creepy.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Versatility:</strong> His regeneration is too
    slow to be applicable in fights, but his survivability lets him continue to
    fight even with entire limbs cut off or his heart stabbed.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;">He hides in his little hideout. He makes 4 clones, all
    with reduced intelligence and combat ability, and they go out and should
    try to fulfill a quest. Deus Vult!</p>
