<p class="vigilante"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Mikhail Jonah
    Parkreiner/January</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Mikhail is an odd
    fellow with just a few strange personality quirks. He has a
    tendency to come across as rather rude and irreverent. This is
    mainly owed to his slight lack of social grace and jester-like
    attitude. He is extremely skeptical of people’s true intentions
    and can come across as bitter or hostile if he feels he
    shouldn’t trust a person. Despite his frequent nightlifing and
    skill as a vigilante, Mikhail has no true aspirations towards
    heroism. Truth be told, he’d much rather be left alone. But
    every now and again there comes someone so vile he finds himself
    forced by his own morality to take action.<br/>

    Takes betrayal very seriously and can hold very long-standing
    grudges if his trust is violated. While rather talkative as a
    civilian, he tends to be much more quiet—almost mute-like—when
    on the job. This done to hide any hints toward his identity.
    Doesn’t like to be called ‘Misha’. Is also Catholic, so he
    attends church whenever he can. Routinely hits the gym to stay
    in top form.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Vigilante. Only
    ever goes after the absolute worst of villains. Will work with
    felons if their goals align.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Description:</strong> Bares the
    athletic build of a young man who engages in regular and
    strenuous physical exercise. He has medium-length, typically
    unkempt, dark colored hair and hazel eyes. Stands at 6’3.<br/>

    He tends to wear very sober, plain clothing. Long-sleeved
    t-shirts or hoodies, and jeans regardless of the weather. While
    on the job he often wears his brother’s brown jacket, sap
    gloves, wraps that cover his forearms, a black shirt, jeans, and
    steel-toed boots. He exposes as little skin as possible. His
    mask is a balaclava and a pair of shaded-goggles.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>History:</strong> Mikhail and his older
    brother Ivan were raised by their alcoholic and abusive
    grandfather, though his brother ran away when Mikhail was ten.
    He was left behind to watch after his ailing grandpa, meaning he
    had take the extra beatings in place of his brother. Adding to
    this, Mikhail began getting into fights not only at school, but
    with adults several years older and several times bigger than
    himself and had garnished a reputation as a problem child.<br/>

    When he was fifteen, Mikhail was taken from his grandfather—who
    was already dying of numerous alcohol-related health issues—by
    his elder brother, who had become an officer of the law after
    serving a couple of years in the Marines. They lived together in
    a small two-bedroom. Though Ivan was often busy with work, he
    and Mikhail were able re-strengthen their relationship, and
    Mikhail’s attitude saw a dramatic improvement. His brother had
    imparted some of the skills he’d picked since he’d struck out on
    his own: armed and unarmed fighting, how to drive, he even
    helped Mikhail ask out his crush, who eventually broke up with
    him when he accidentally fed her his pet gerbil.<br/>

    On the eve of Mikhail’s seventeenth birthday, Ivan had been
    murdered on the orders of some crime lord he’d managed to
    offend. Grief-stricken and enraged by the police’s inability (or
    refusal) to do anything about it, Mikhail went off the deep end,
    investigating the crime boss with neurotic fervor. When he’d
    finally managed track down the dirty bastard, knife in hand
    Mikhail flew into a rage, attacking the man and his group of
    cronies. Mikhail blacked out and when he came to, he was covered
    in cuts and bruises—the other guys lie on the ground, their
    bodies burned beyond all recognition.<br/>

    It was supposed to end there. Mikhail had gotten his vengeance
    and could've walked away from it all. But every now and again a
    story would bounce around about some child with an
    “overly-strict” parent. Or news about a series of girls going
    missing and turning up later minus a few important organs. Or an
    old store owner who earned the ire of some local crime boss.
    Something that police couldn’t (or wouldn’t) handle. Something
    that other heroes were too “busy” to take care of. And every now
    and again, for three years, Mikhail would find himself prowling
    the night in some idiot's play at being a hero.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Power:</strong> <u>Connectivity
    Manipulation</u> - January has the ability to manipulate spatial
    adjacency. Basically he can mount “portals” directly onto open
    air and use them to swap the location of two spaces and can
    either conserve the connectivity of swapped spaces or sever
    them—though he cannot sever the connectivity of any material
    with an ultimate tensile strength of 20 megapascals or greater.
    In other words, he cannot split human skin, hair, or bones with
    his powers. He can apply this to objects, transporting them by
    swapping the space around them with another. He can split
    rubber, marble, concrete, and some epoxy adhesives, as well as
    pure lead and tin.<br/>

    15 meter radius at absolute limit. Has 3 charges. Each use
    drains 1 charge and “portals” remain open for a single turn (30
    seconds). Takes 2 turns to recover a single charge. Redirection
    use 2 charges.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Versatility:</strong> With his
    connectivity manipulation, one of January’s abilities is
    teleportation, by swapping the space he’s occupying with
    another, he can then move himself to that spot. He incorporates
    this into hand-to-hand combat, pulling off confusing attacks by
    teleporting parts of his body and striking from seemingly
    impossible angles. Another use of this power is redirection. Say
    a projectile is fired at January, he can swap the space the
    projectile is occupying with another space, causing it to miss.
    He can also re-orientate the space and have it fire back at the
    sender.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Demo:</strong> <br/>
    <u>Ex. 1</u>: January raises his arm, blocking the wild haymaker
    of his aggressor. Swapping the space of his lower body for the
    space behind his opponent, January appears to be a floating
    upper body. His legs positioned behind his opponent, January
    drives his heel into the back of the man’s knees, causing him to
    falter to the ground. January draws his baton and smashes it
    into the side of the thug's head.<br/>

    <u>Ex. 2</u>: A brick is hurled at January. As the object
    approaches him, he re-orientates the space it occupies, flipping
    it around and sending it back to the thrower.</p>
