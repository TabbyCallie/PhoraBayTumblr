<p class="vigilante"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Vyaan
    Burman/Avant</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Age:</strong> 18</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Vyaan is a kind,
    hardworking and caring individual, but he can sometimes be
    persistent. He is a very helpful, responsible and busy young
    man, as well organized, level-headed and sometimes quite
    serious. He may even be called quite sensitive towards others,
    as he is quick to anger. This can cause him to come off as
    impatient and stubborn. He is somewhat blunt, and he sometimes
    accidentally blurts out the first thing on his mind without
    restraint or tact when he is nervous or stressed, whether it may
    be wrong or right.</p>

    brown hair and dark blue eyes. He is tall, has broad shoulders
    and is of fair complexion. He usually wears a shirt and trousers
    with semi-formal slip-on shoes during work or in university.

<p class="vigilante"><strong>History:</strong> Vyaan is an
    eighteen-year-old Indian student who has just landed in Phora
    Bay to pursue Bachelors in Journalism. His goals in life are
    quite simple; be a freelance journalist and help expose all the
    evils of the world. He had always secretly wanted to become a
    hero, but unfortunately, he did not seem to have any kind of
    power or ability which made him special. So naturally, he
    decided to go for much more practical aspirations. His favorite
    color is magenta, loves to cook and listen to indie music and
    like to stay clear of dangers. But if required, he is ready to
    risk life for a friend. Right now, He's a lone young man,
    exploring a new fantasy land.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Resources:</strong> $1000 in his bank
    account (He's unemployed and homeless rn. I'm planning to RP how
    he settles down)</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Equipment:</strong> a big travel bag
    filled with his belongings, like clothes and books (and a
    cellphone)</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Skills:</strong> A good runner, a good
    photographer, a good cook and quite proficient with tricks
    involving sleight of hands.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Power:</strong> <u>Magnitude
    Control</u>: Unbeknownst to him (till now), Vyaan has the
    ability to amplify or reduce anybody's powers. This is
    applicable only on humans with powers. It does not control
    anything else. </p>

<ul class="vigilante">
    <li><u>Amplification</u>: Needs to be in direct (skin to skin)
        or indirect (with maximum one medium) physical contact with
        the individual for activation. So the power will work if he
        touches a naked back of a man or a back covered by just one
        piece of clothing, but anything more than that and it will
        not activate his power. Can buff power upto 50% (as of now)
        of the current limit:
        <ul>
            <li>30% for 3 turns, cooldown of 6 turns</li>
            <li>50% for 3 turns, cooldown of 10 turns</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><u>Diminishement</u>: Direct skin contact/contact with the
        physical form of the power needed to activate. Can reduce
        the magnitude of the power upto 50% (as of now) of the
        current limit.
        <ul>
            <li>40% for 3 turns, cooldown of 6 turns</li>
            <li>50% for 3 turns, cooldown of 9 turns</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Versatility:</strong> While he doesn't
    know anything about his powers yet, his ability can be utilised
    as a good support in both offensive and defensive situations. He
    can boost last minute attacks of an ally to give him a surprise
    advantage, while he can debuff an enemy to put him at an
    unexpected disadvantage. The power can also be used to weaken
    the opponent before laying a surprise ambush on them.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Demo:</strong> <u>Current</u>:
    Confronted by goon with enhanced strength, runs away.<br />

    <u>Once he comes to know about his powers</u>: Confronted by
    goons with enhanced strength, The goon punches him, Vyaan blocks
    with hand and triggers diminisher, reducing the goon's power by
    30%, thus taking less damage followed by running away.</p>
