<h1 class="rogue">Mercy</h1>
<p class="rogue"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Rome Rivers/Mercy</p>


<p class="rogue"><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p>

<p class="rogue"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Rome is a rather neutral
    person. She wants to get through her day peacefully-without any violence
    and disruption. Rome prefers order and repetition... any sudden changes
    that are unexpected throws her off balance. She isn't a perfectionist, but
    she aims to seek excellence. Rome believes everyone can be a good person,
    if they are at the feet of mercy, upon their knees, then they'll eventually
    do anything to keep their somewhat pathetic lives. She disagrees on the
    forces of 'good' and 'evil' and wishes to remain in the middle of the
    conflict. Strangers may describe Rome as being uninterested and keeping to
    small talk...after a drink or two, they might think differently...</p>

<p class="rogue"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Rogue </p>

<p class="rogue"><strong>Description:</strong> Rome dyed her hair a light,
    soft blue colour to match her eyes. She's rather slim and looks like a
    single punch can shatter her into pieces...Her complexion and normal
    expression makes her seem easy to approach and befriend...</p>

<p class="rogue"><strong>History:</strong> Rome never knew her real
    family. The people she grew up with, kind and rather simple religious folks
    that decided to take her under their wing and raise her as if she were
    theirs. As a child, Rome was a troublemaker, she did everything she could
    to get these people to hate her and give her up. She would test them, push
    their buttons...anything she could think of, but the couple never budged.
    They still loved her, cared for her and kept her. Until one day, Rome broke
    down crying, question why these people won't leave her alone and give her
    away for a 'better' child...She claimed that she was too late to
    save...This made her 'father' slightly disappointed. His words still
    ring in her ears...<br/>

    "With mercy and sympathy, no one will hate to love one another" Ever since
    then she decided to reform herself and become a better person. Rome's ideas
    and opinions all link back to that day. Her parents' teaches and lessons
    helped shape the person she is today... Rome now works at a restaurant and
    other various part-time jobs to sustain her life. Although, it isn't
    muchâ€”it's enough for her simple life.</p>

<p class="rogue"><strong>Power:</strong> Mercy's Blessings<br/>
    The user is able to 'bless' allies. This allows them to get a small buff
    that may help in situations. The user requires a lot of focus to bless the
    multiple items and allow them to be used to their full extent. If the user
    were to be disturbed, then they would suffer headaches, random cuts and
    wounds will appear on their body, and they may feel a little tipsy...
    The user normally gives out their blessings through bracelets. These
    bracelets are different colors, representing the different effects that
    they give. The user carries around 30 bracelets in total. Target(s) may
    only have 3 bracelets on max or the effects will all cancel out. In order
    for the effects to maintain, target(s) must be within a 25-meter range of
    the user... Or the blessing will wear off...<br/>

    Red Bracelets: When the target(s) wear this bracelet, they are blessed
    +4 kN. Targets can choose whether they can use the blessing on their
    physical attacks(punches, kicks) or power. This blessing lasts for 4 turns
    before wearing off. Carries 5 One per person. <br/>

    Blue Bracelets: When the target(s) wear this bracelet, they are blessed
    with 5 kN more durability/defense. This blessing last for 4 turns.
    Carries 5. One per person. <br/>

    Green Bracelets: When target(s) wear this bracelet, they are blessed with a
    boosted regenerative cells... 1 bracelet is used for healing small cuts and
    wounds within 1 turn... 2 bracelets are used for healing more major wounds
    and burns within 4 turns... 3 bracelet is used for faster healing,
    target(s) recover within 2-3 turns... Carries 20 After when the target(s)
    are fully healed, bracelets loose effect.<br/>

    After when bracelets' blessing is gone... the item cannot be blessed again.
    The user must go and restock on the unblessed bracelets. When the target(s)
    have the max number of bracelets(3) and used up their blessings, a cooldown
    of 4 turns start before they can receive more blessings...<br/>

    Mercy is only able to wear one blue or one red at any time to boost herself
    and is limited to only giving a total of two blue or red bracelets to any
    allies at a time.</p>
