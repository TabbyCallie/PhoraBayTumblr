<p class="vigilante"><strong>History:</strong> Minerva, Code Name:
    Auralya was raised in a small village that raised all of their
    local inhabitants to become ninjas. When her power showed
    itself, she quickly rose to the top of her class and graduated
    early due to the benefit of her power.  Graduating 3 years
    early, she decided to take a hiatus from her duties and learn
    what it means to possess powers and what should be done with
    them. She traveled various lands, helping people discreetly and
    knocking out villains to deliver them to the cops. After her
    three year hiatus, she returned home and they told her of a city
    known as Phora Bay that can use her help. She accepts their
    mission and travels to Phora Bay in order to help the police
    there and save innocent lives.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Resources:</strong> Auralya has a small
    house with a garage on the south side of the city and a bank
    account. With 2k ollars that auto pays her bills but she has no
    access to otherwise and a brand new motorcycle that she uses for
    travel.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Equipment:</strong> She carries on her
    at all times 10 kunai knives and a tanto.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Skills:</strong> Lock-picking, hand to
    hand combat, basic parkour, pinpoint accuracy with thrown
    weapons, excellent ability to hide, and extreme proficiency with
    her trusty tanto.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Power:</strong> <u>Flash Mirror
    Images</u>: the user can summon two images of herself that can
    mimic simple moves and be controlled.</p>
<ul class="vigilante">
    <li>Mirror images last 5 turns, have a 5 turn cooldown, can
        travel up to 15 meters away from her, and cannot hurt
        themselves by any means (they can jump off a building or
        shoot themselves.) It takes a minor beating or a
        stab/gunshot to destroy them and causes them to explode in a
        shower of sparkles that functions as a smokescreen of
        sparkles.</li>
    <li>Mirror Images can handle small weaponry such as small blades
        and kunai knives as well as small guns such as pistols and
        small SMG's and do the same damage as Aurayla.</li>
</ul>
<p class="vigilante">Auralya also has the ability to trade places
    with her images using an ability.</br>

    <u>Mirror Transfer</u>: Auralya can trade places with her Mirror
    Images on a 4 turn cooldown. This transfer is instant and can
    happen in motion, but both the image and Auralya lose all
    momentum. This also applies to if the image is jumping or
    falling. She must have full vision of the image for this to
    work.</p>

<p class="vigilante">Versatility: Flash Mirror Images can mimic can
    throw kunai knives in synchronicity with Auralya letting her
    throw three kunai instead of just one. She can also use the
    mirror images to lead her attackers astray if she runs one way
    while they run another.</p>

<p class="vigilante"><strong>Demo:</strong> If she is fighting a
    thug on the street she can use her quirk to flash summon 2
    copies of herself and all three will throw a kunai knife at full
    human damage</p>
