<h1 class="hero">Bubblegum</h1>

<p class="hero"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Thomas
    McQueen/Bubblegum</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>Age:</strong> 27</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Thomas is a cool guy,
    friendly and smart all the way, but he's such a show off it can
    undermine everything. He's a great fan of music, the likes of MJ
    and such. He also loves to chew gum and take care of his
    ferret.</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Hero</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>Description:</strong></p>Thomas looks like a
    rainbow. There are different colors all over his body that
    definitely sets him apart from the other people. His hair is a
    mixture of black, grey, green, indigo and magenta, and his eyes
    are light green. He likes to wear button-up shirts and high
    boots. Thomas was a guy that loved bubblegums, and could always
    be seen chewing one. One day, he caused quite the accident,
    filling his whole house with bubblegum. It took time for him to
    understand what happened, and to clean it all from the sticky
    gum, but once he discovered that he could manipulate rubber, he
    began to use his powers to its full potential, that is, a
    bubblegum factory. He's the top dog in the bubblegum branch,
    having attained the monopoly of fabrication of bubblegums, just
    because he can get insane amounts of everlasting bubblegum and
    no one knows how.<br/>

    As a rich man known by the people, he became a sponsor of the
    Hero Vanguard. Some of them were adamant about him not being a
    Hero, due to the danger of the job. However, against their
    advice, he plays the Hero Bubblegum.<br/>

    At some moment during his childhood, he acquired a ferret that
    apparently has longevity, seeing as it didn't die yet, nor
    showed any signs of age. All that is known about it is that it's
    older than 2 decades. His name is JoJo.</p>

<p class="hero"><strong>Resources:</strong> Thomas is the CEO of
    Bubble Corps, a company that works with the fabrication of
    bubblegums, and plans on expanding the branch of glue as well.
    He has 500k dollars in spare and earns 50k dollars for free
    use.</p>

<p class="hero"> <strong>Equipment:</strong> Thomas has a
    Bubblegum Stash, how he calls the boxes filled with bublegum he
    has in his pocket, each one has 15 bubblegums. He also has an
    iPod and headphones.</p>

<p class="hero"> <strong>Skills:</strong> Administration,
    Dance-Fighting, Playing Guitar, Throwing</p>

<p class="hero"> <strong>Power:</strong> Rubberband<br/>

    Thomas can create extremely flexible, durable and elastic rubber
    which he can change the stickiness and shape at will by imbuing
    his energy on it, which has the appearance of a pink aura. He
    can use the rubber for many things, including climbing on
    surfaces with sticky gloves, binding people with sticky whips,
    pulling people within punching range for a rebound of pummels,
    stanch wounds and overall industrial production. The rubber is
    incredibly resistant, seeing as it can be stretched really far
    and can be used as means to return an attack to their original
    caster.<br/>

    The main creations of Thomas are his bubblegums, which he got
    himself rich with and are his primary means of attack. He can
    make incredibly resistant bubbles that can either stick to any
    surface or simply bounce off attacks under 8kN. Even a needle
    would have problems piercing it.<br/>

    Thomas can also harden the rubber, turning it into weapons,
    shields or prisons that can be changed back after 2 turns.</p>
<ul class="hero">
    <li>The rubber can be stretched up to 7m</li>
    <li>Thomas can change the shape of the rubber within a range of
        2m from him</li>
    <li>The rubber loses 1/4 of its durability when sticky </li>
    <li>The rubber can withstand a force of 12kN, while the thin
        layer of the bubbles can only withstand 8kN </li>
    <li>The rubber can deflect attacks under 4kN towards the
        original caster </li>
    <li>With control over the stickiness, Thomas can make the rubber
        stick to any surface or bounce off walls like a pinball
        projectile. Rebound attacks have a force of 4kN </li>
    <li>The rubber can withstand 200kG, anything above it will tear
        it apart </li>
    <li>The bubbles last 3 turns before popping after reaching their
        maximum diameter of 5m </li>
    <li>Thomas can either blow bubbles by himself, in which case
        they'll expand at a rate of 2m/s, or leave them to expand by
        themselves if stepped on, in which case they'll expand at a
        rate of 2m per turn after immediately expanding to 1m </li>
    <li>Thomas can see through the rubber by imbuing his energy on
        it, but that only applies to him </li>
    <li>The hardened rubber can withstand a force of 10kN and an
        impact of 5kN, and anything higher than that will make it
        tear apart </li>
</ul>
<p class="hero"> Additionally, he can generate more saliva than a
    normal human, allowing to chew an infinite amount of bubblegums
    without getting dry mouth. He also has a greater lung capacity,
    allowing him to blow big bubbles without running out of
    breath.</p>

<p class="hero"> <strong>Versatility:</strong> Thomas can use is
    rubber to stick on surfaces and people, stretch it to make
    things akin to whips that can be used to immobilize people and
    bungee jump, inflate the bubbles like balloons to restrain
    people's movements, and many other things</p>

<p class="hero"> <strong>Demo:</strong> The hero grabbed two
    bubblegums out of his pocket and activated his power. A pink
    aura began to flow from the bubblegums and their shape began to
    change into whips. He swung both of them at the thug in front of
    him and began to wrap him on it, a sticky and elastic trap.</p>
