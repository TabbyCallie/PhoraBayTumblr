<h1 style="color:#93f;">ViVi</h1>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Name / Alias:</strong> Victoria Victoire/ViVi</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Age:</strong> 23</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Mentality:</strong> “Better to speak the ugly
    truth than say a pretty lie.” She basically is very blunt and hates
    withholding the truth even if it means making someone feel bad. ViVi is a
    very laid back individual who just happens to drink more coffee than is
    usually healthy for a normal person. She recently bought a café but she’s
    not exactly sure on how to run some aspects of it and sometimes gives
    delicious coffee away for free, if not dirt cheap.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Rogue</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Description:</strong> ViVi generally wears very
    old clothes that look like hand-me-downs and has no scars. She constantly
    looks like she’s in a bad mood even if she’s in a good mood.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>History:</strong> Born in a small unimportant
    town, ViVi has always had her manifestation of her soul by her side but
    she’s never been able to find the right name for it and just calls it Mani
    for the time being. After she moved to Phora Bay, she bought a café,
    thinking she could run it but has had no luck as of yet. She hasn’t done
    anything particularly bad but she hasn’t done anything good either.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Resources:</strong> The café near city gardens
    is pretty much her only property besides some clothes and the things
    necessary to run the café. She’s lower middle class and she lives in the
    attic of her café to save money. $40,000/year.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Nothing but the clothes on
    her back plus a baseball cap.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Skills:</strong> Hot drink making,
    procrastinating, and being sarcastic.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Power:</strong> Can summon a manifestation of
    her soul that can heat anything it touches up to 300 degrees celsius. Mani
    can’t go beyond a meter away from ViVi and it has to touch the object to
    heat it up.</p>
<ul style="color:#93f;">
    <li>Can heat up things to 300 C max</li>
    <li>Takes 30 seconds to heat up to maximum temperature and 10 seconds per
        100 C.</li>
    <li>7kN Punch</li>
    <li>8kN Kick</li>
    <li>7kN Durability</li>
    <li>Power upon contact heats up a 3 meter radius.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#93f;"><em>Note: Mani can’t cool things down, only heat things
    up.</em></p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Versatility:</strong> She mostly uses her power
    to heat up coffee, tea and other hot drinks, but she can use it in combat
    situations if she has to. When in a combat situation, Mani can boil the
    victim’s blood until they pass out or die.</p>

<p style="color:#93f;"><strong>Demo:</strong> As ViVi walked through the alley,
    two thugs cut off her escape. “Oi, whadya think ya doing cutting me off?
    It’s bad enough in traffic, but now ya city folk are cutting me off on my
    way to work!” The two thugs looked at each other for a moment before
    laughing at her. One pulled out a switch blade and went for ViVi’s right
    arm. “Oh sod off ya fucking luddite.” She said as Mani appeared and grabbed
    the man’s arm and boiled his blood.</p>
