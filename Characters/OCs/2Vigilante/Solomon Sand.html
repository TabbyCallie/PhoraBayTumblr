<h1 style="color:#66f;">Solomon Sand</h1>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Alan Valentine/Jack
    Valentine Burrick/“Solomon Sand”</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Age:</strong> 27</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Conserved, he will always do
    what he thinks is right to the utmost ability. He tends to have a goofy
    side and enjoys simple hobbies to the extreme. He’s often awkward without
    knowing it, and very belligerent with a bit of a loose temperament.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Vigilante</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Description:</strong> A large muscular man, Jack
    was a sailor for most of his life. He has a lean body, and a fairly good
    face covered in freckles. He typically needs glasses to see. He has dark
    ginger hair and shiny green eyes. When he dons his Solomon Sand persona, he
    wears a large white trench coat made out of a loose latex and cloth
    interweave for water and heat protection. On top of Jack’s head is a full
    face helmet that hides his identity. The helmet appears to be made out of
    metal which has a radio and oxygen system built in it. On his missing hand,
    he replaces his normal prosthetic with a large sharpened sickle.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>History:</strong> Jack Valentine Burrick comes
    from a formerly wealthy and prestigious family. After college, Jack took up
    his family fishing business where he lost his right hand in a freak
    accident involving a shark, a can of worms, and a bottle of tequila. Jack
    then spent money on an advanced prosthetic arm for use, and he continued
    his fishing business.<br />

    However, one day, his spoiled brother and sister decided to rob a bank for
    shits and giggles and take refuge on Jack’s barge unbeknownst to Jack. As
    such when the authorities came looking for them, they detained Jack,
    treating him as a common criminal.<br />

    During the fight in which a hero blew up his fishing barge, Jack’s sister,
    Mary, died and Jack became unemployed. Jack’s little brother, Tom, now
    arrested for his misuse of gravity powers, pleaded for Jack’s help, but
    Jack was angry and nearly suffocated tom in his prison cell. During his
    stay in the prison's isolation unit, Jack discovered he inherited the power
    of his rumored ancestor. Jack gained the ability to pass through the
    corporeal world, and he phased all the way home.<br />

    Now a free man, Jack decided that he would do a better job than the
    so-called “heroes” and keep people safe. However, since he was a fugitive,
    he couldn’t become an official hero. So, Jack Valentine adopted the persona
    of Solomon Sand, to strike fear into the hearts of the common criminal. He
    arrived in the city and began his life as Alan Valentine and Solomon
    Sand....</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Resources:</strong> Jack has spent the leftovers
    of his family’s wealth to construct a medium house in the suburbs and his
    special suit and equipment. Jack holds a bachelor’s degree. in Chemical
    Engineering and uses a fake Ph.D. degree to work at Bubble Corps under the
    guise of Alan Valentine. As such he makes around 80k a year developing
    miscellaneous bubblegums and other chemicals.<br />

    The house is a medium size two story house with a basement and attic,
    measuring at about 20x15m. It has the standards such as a living area, 2
    bedrooms, a kitchen, a dining area and w bathrooms with plumbing. However,
    there is a small room hidden in the basement that contains a small but
    efficient laboratory, an investigators kit, and his equipment. His house is
    located at 1939 Kane Dr. There are two trees and a picket fence surrounding
    the brick house. Its cost of living is about $3,000 a month.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Equipment:</strong> As Solomon, he wears a
    trench-coat/wetsuit hybrid that insulates from changes in heat, cold, and
    electricity. It has a triple weave of Kevlar laid in it protecting him from
    damage and forces up to 8 kN. The suit has a breathing apparatus for
    underwater use. He has a radio built into the helmet to know for sure when
    he is phased and unphased. He has a sharp 1080 spring-steel sickle attached
    to his right hand for CQC that can withstand almost any impact such as hard
    punches and other abuse while always bouncing back to shape. As a backup,
    Solomon carries pepper spray. Alan/Jack doesn’t really carry any weapons,
    outside of his prosthetic limb.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Skills:</strong></p>
<ul style="color:#66f;">
    <li>Jack has a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from his
        university days. As such he is skilled in most forms of chemical
        manipulation in the form of bombs, bonds, and other adhesives and gas
        forms.</li>
    <li>From his experiences in prison, Jack is an experienced brawler but
        relies on his ability and strength to overcome his foes.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Power:</strong> Solomon Sand has the ability to
    phase through solid matter. When doing so, any corporeal form including all
    manners of wavelengths and heat pass through harmlessly and get converted
    into his kinetic blast (although, some heat may still escape).<br />

    Solomon can pass through biological matter, but cannot reform inside of it
    nor can any material dropped while phased into biomatter return to
    corporeal form until it is outside of the mass. However, when
    re-materializing, the power will push away any biomass smaller than 2 lbs
    to make room for Solomon's form.<br />

    While phased, Solomon emits a faint green shimmering light all around his
    body. Soundwaves do not escape being phased, and as such Solomon is
    completely silent while phased.<br />

    Any attack that does not rely on a corporeal form such as entirely
    spectral, entirely magic, or such can still attack Solomon. But if they
    rely only or partially on a corporeal form, such as shadow force, lightning
    and so on, they will pass through. Solomon can also only make non-living
    material phased with him, and as such cannot phase people into other
    materials.<br />

    <u>Phasement</u>:<br />

    Solomon’s phasing can be active for up to 5 turns, where each turn requires
    an equal cool down.</p>
<ul style="color:#66f;">
    <li>1 turn of Phasement = 1 cooldown</li>
    <li>5 turns of Phasement = 5 cooldown</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#66f;"><u>Kinetic Blast</u>:<br />

    Once a Phasement is over, all of the malicious energy, wavelengths, force,
    etc. That passed through harmlessly will be converted into a kinetic force
    shockwave that will trigger on the first connected strike with an entity
    after Phasement, sending a concentrated blast of converted force shockwave
    through their body. Additionally, to deliver the full blast of energy
    without decay, Solomon must exit Phasement immediately. Solomon only has
    the turn after to deliver that hit at full capacity, the energy decays by
    50% the turn after that, and every turn after the initial “hit” decreases
    by 25% until zero even while phased.<br /></p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Versatility:</strong> Solomon phases through
    attacks to release a energy and deliver a finishing blow. While phased,
    Solomon will attempt to strike fear into the minds of his enemies. Solomon
    will let several hits pass through him before releasing it into a
    supernatural punch that sends people flying. He uses his scythe to cut the
    tendons and immobilize his more troublesome foes. Once his foes have been
    dealt with, he will strip them and chain them to a sturdy object for the
    police to find.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Demo:</strong> a villain decides to run over
    Solomon with a speeding truck, the truck passes harmlessly through Solomon.
    The villain attempts to recover by engaging in close quarters combat with
    Solomon, The villain is hit with the exact force of the speeding truck,
    obliterating the weak villain.</p>
