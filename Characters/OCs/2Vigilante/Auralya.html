<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>History:</strong> Minerva, Code Name: Auralya
    was raised in a small village that raised all of their local inhabitants to
    become ninjas. When her power showed itself, she quickly rose to the top of
    her class and graduated early due to the benefit of her power.  Graduating
    3 years early, she decided to take a hiatus from her duties and learn what
    it means to possess powers and what should be done with them. She traveled
    various lands, helping people discreetly and knocking out villains to
    deliver them to the cops. After her three year hiatus, she returned home
    and they told her of a city known as Phora Bay that can use her help. She
    accepts their mission and travels to Phora Bay in order to help the police
    there and save innocent lives.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Resources:</strong> Auralya has a small house
    with a garage on the south side of the city and a bank account. With 2k
    ollars that auto pays her bills but she has no access to otherwise and a
    brand new motorcycle that she uses for travel.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Equipment:</strong> She carries on her at all
    times 10 kunai knives and a tanto.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Skills:</strong> Lock-picking, hand to hand
    combat, basic parkour, pinpoint accuracy with thrown weapons, excellent
    ability to hide, and extreme proficiency with her trusty tanto.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Power:</strong> <u>Flash Mirror Images</u>: the
    user can summon two images of herself that can mimic simple moves and be
    controlled.</p>
<ul>
    <li style="color:#66f;">Mirror images last 5 turns, have a 5 turn
        cooldown, can travel up to 15 meters away from her, and cannot hurt
        themselves by any means (they can jump off a building or shoot
        themselves.) It takes a minor beating or a stab/gunshot to destroy
        them and causes them to explode in a shower of sparkles that
        functions as a smokescreen of sparkles.
    </li>
    <li style="color:#66f;">Mirror Images can handle small weaponry such as
        small blades and kunai knives as well as small guns such as pistols
        and small SMG's and do the same damage as Aurayla.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#66f;">Auralya also has the ability to trade places with her
    images using an ability.</br>

    <u>Mirror Transfer</u>: Auralya can trade places with her Mirror Images on
    a 4 turn cooldown. This transfer is instant and can happen in motion, but
    both the image and Auralya lose all momentum. This also applies to if the
    image is jumping or falling. She must have full vision of the image for
    this to work.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;">Versatility: Flash Mirror Images can mimic can throw
    kunai knives in synchronicity with Auralya letting her throw three kunai
    instead of just one. She can also use the mirror images to lead her
    attackers astray if she runs one way while they run another.</p>

<p style="color:#66f;"><strong>Demo:</strong> If she is fighting a thug on the
    street she can use her quirk to flash summon 2 copies of herself and all
    three will throw a kunai knife at full human damage</p>
