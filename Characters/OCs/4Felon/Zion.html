<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>History:</strong> He started developing his
    powers since a young age, ever since he started getting possessive
    thoughts. At around the age of 10, he became a leader of his childhood
    friend gang. After a year that gang ended up influencing all similar
    children groups in the neighborhood. That was his first taste of power and
    the feeling was intoxicating to him, thus he started wanting more. At age
    of 18, he enrolled in a rather prestigious university to study psychology,
    politics, and law through “fair” means and next year he became a student
    council president. The votings were “totally legit” and no bribery or vote
    rigging was involved. After graduating at the age of 23 he migrated to
    Phora Bay and started setting sight on the place. “This place is
    interesting and I want it” is what he said after a year living here and
    thus started working on taking control of the underworld under the name of
    Zion, while his public face was a lawyer named Johnny.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Resources:</strong> $3000 a month from his
    lawyer wage, as well as whatever income his controlled organizations as
    Zion brings him. A motorcycle and a reasonable size apartment.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Three 10kg steel balls as
    well as three daggers on him.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Skills:</strong> Manipulation, psychology,
    law.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Power:</strong> Zone of Control. Zion can create
    a domain-like zone of 30 meters in diameter either around him or he can
    prepare a small zone sphere which he can throw at 10m/s which expands
    either on impact or when Zion wishes. Zion needs to wait a turn to use the
    zone. Zone's cooldown is 1/4th of the time it was used with 2 turn cooldown
    as a minimum. This zone has various properties which can be summed up in 2
    categories: the inside of the zone and the membrane of the zone. Inside
    zone abilities - immunity to mental effects as well, telekinesis
    (affectable weight limit as well as singular lifting weight limit is
    1000kg).<br />

    <u>Telekinesis weight to speed ratio</u>:</p>
<ul style="color:#f37;">
    <li>1000 kg -> 5 m/s</li>
    <li>500 kg -> 6 m/s</li>
    <li>250 kg -> 8 m/s</li>
    <li>100 kg -> 10 m/s</li>
    <li>50 kg -> 15 m/s</li>
    <li>10 kg -> 30 m/s</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#f37;">Membrane abilities - can slow and weaken any attack
    which passes through, the slow effect is proportionate to the attack’s
    weight and Zion’s TK speed limit, this is a reactionary passive effect. It
    can change the way membrane looks.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Versatility:</strong> It is a very versatile
    ability, providing both offenses with telekinesis by sending heavy objects
    at an enemy’s face, defense thanks to the nature of telekinesis as well as
    the membrane as well as utility gained from telekinesis and who knows what
    his zone will be able to do later on.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Demo:</strong> Zion sees a serial killer pulling
    out a knife and starting charging at him, thus he sets up a zone around
    himself. The serial killer gets cautious by the ominous looking sphere in
    front of him, thus deciding not to enter it and threw a knife aiming at
    Zion at 20m/s, however once the knife passed through the membrane it
    stopped completely because it’s speed didn’t exceed 30m/s. Zion looked at
    the dagger pointing at him and made it point towards the criminal, and sent
    it flying back at him at 30m/s, once the knife left the zone, it’s speed
    was somewhat retained thanks to inertia, though the speed kept decreasing
    slightly yet it was still enough to make that knife stab into SKs
    throat.</p>
