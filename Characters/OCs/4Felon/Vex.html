<h1 style="color:#f37;">Vex</h1>
<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Adrienne Bellamy/Vex</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Age:</strong> 22</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Confident, prideful,
    obsessive, impulsive, and <em>incredibly</em> vain, Vex is a manipulative
    hedonist and sadomasochist. Seemingly on a whim, she takes a fervent
    interest in other persons (especially parahumans) and stalks them.
    Sometimes her attention is harmless or playful, but more often than not she
    will torment them or attempt to lure and/or bait the individual into an
    ambush before torturing them. Likes expensive things, especially wine.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Felon</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Description:</strong> Adrienne has fine and
    beautiful features, that further accentuated by black hair, jade-green
    eyes, and a slender 'hourglass' physique. Put simply, she's drop-dead
    gorgeous, and being as vain and prideful as she is, she doesn't hide that
    she knows it.<br />

    In her cape persona as Vex, Adrienne wears a demonic mask as well as a
    form-fitting and <em>very</em> flattering black dress</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>History:</strong> Originally from France, she
    came to America after she met an influential supervillain vacationing in
    his civilian identity and became instantly and utterly smitten with the
    man. (One might even suspect foul play from a power...) He didn't feel the
    same way for her, but led her on as though he did to satisfy his own
    selfish interests, eventually taking her back to America with him but
    considering her to be essentially nothing more than arm candy - while to
    Adrienne, it seemed as though this was nothing less than the start of a new
    life with her soulmate. Now back in his element, it didn't take long before
    the villain tired of his charade, and while conducting business in Phora he
    left Adrienne sitting alone in a café halfway through a romantic lunch
    after excusing himself to take a phone call.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Resources:</strong> None, she was left with
    nothing but the clothes on her back and the money in her pocket after being
    left alone.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Vex carries a tactical light
    small enough to fit in her palm, a whistle, a taser, a small can of pepper
    spray, smelling salts, a lighter, a set of torturer's tools, zip-ties
    and/or handcuffs, a karambit, and a cat o' nine tails.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Skills:</strong> Speaks English, French, a
    little German, lies like a pro and spots them just as easily. She’s
    <em>very</em> perceptive, allowing her to be good at reading people and
    situations, knows how to escape cuffs and zip-ties, familiar with the human
    anatomy — especially pressure points, has some limited training with a
    karambit. Lastly, she’s a skilled violinist.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Power:</strong> Vex can target one person
    through sight up to a max range of 25m and cause their senses to become
    1/4x less sensitive to her or objects on her person, or up to 10x
    <em>more</em> sensitive to her or objects on her person. (For reference, a
    dog's hearing is about 4x that of a human's.) Vex's power doesn't
    <em>actually</em> amplify/dull the sensations she causes but instead
    amplifies/dulls the perception of the sensation. So she could make a
    firework deafeningly loud, but she wouldn't actually cause any damage to
    someone's hearing and deafen them unless it normally would. Vex is able to
    selectively target specific senses to enhance, and line of sight doesn't
    need to be maintained for the power to work after she chooses a target.
    Enhanced or extra senses can be affected as well, and do not hinder the
    potency of the sensitivity change.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Versatility:</strong> Versatility is fairly low,
    though the power has a few tricks that can be leveraged outside of the most
    direct use of the power such as whispering across a room, or making her
    harder/easier to find in a crowd.</p>

<p style="color:#f37;"><strong>Demo:</strong> Before he was writhing in the
    dirt, he was a lawyer. The setup was simple, Adrienne had invited him to
    come out to a bar, and had enhanced his senses to make her perfume so,
    <em>so</em> easy to smell - the best part? It was the same kind as his
    deceased wife's. She had him basically wrapped around her finger the whole
    night, and when she suggested moving somewhere 'private', his
    alcohol-seeped mind didn't even allow him a second thought. A couple
    streets down, and an alley or two later she'd taken him down with a heel to
    the thigh. As he lay crying in pain and sobbing, Vex fished out a knife
    from a well-concealed thigh sheath...</p>
