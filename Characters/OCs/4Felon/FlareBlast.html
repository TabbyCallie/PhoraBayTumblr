    <strong>History:</strong> Amy was a sheltered child, to say the least. Her
    family controlling basically every aspect of her life. Of course, like a
    good little girl, she obeyed without question to their every whim. Learning
    what they wanted her to learn. Practicing the skills they told her to.
    There was no freedom. But how could she know something she had never
    experienced? <br />

    That is, until her 15th birthday. Where, as a celebration of sorts, her
    family had taken her out to camp. As they were just finishing, packing
    their things to leave the sight, Amy got a spark. A sudden sensation. A
    thought that held so much weight that she mindlessly wandered away from her
    unsuspecting family. Them having made clear orders for her to stay put, and
    not even thinking she would disobey.<br />

    It was dark out. The only light she would have as she moved throughout the
    forest a shiny moon in the sky. But that only did so much. No parents in
    sight. No one giving her a command.  No more rules. For the first time in
    her life…true freedom. She smiled. A genuine smile, one that would soon
    turn into a small smirk. <br />

    She started to walk faster, and faster. Then she would jog, and finally,
    she burst out in a full-on sprint! Running throughout the woods with
    reckless glee! The wind in her hair as she laughed in joy! That is until
    she heard it. She heard them. Her family. They had come looking for her.
    Their voices loud and commanding, always loud and commanding. She stopped
    dead in her tracks, her head turning towards their voices. She almost went
    to them on instinct alone. Almost.<br />

    She was different now. She had, had her first actual taste of freedom. And
    Amy wasn’t giving it up. Her mind was made, and her family wasn’t ever
    gonna get their ‘precious’ girl back now.<br />

    And that’s when it happened. She hadn’t noticed at first, mind still being
    filled with all these new emotions. Emotions she had never knew existed.
    Joy, fear, desperation…rage.<br />

    Without her knowledge, her entire body burst out in flames. Her skin now
    molten rock and her once red hair now a fierce storm of fire. She narrowed
    her eyes in the direction of her family, unconsciously raising her hands.
    And as if on instinct, she let out a torrent of flame! <br />

    The entire forest was burned to the ground that night. No casualties, only
    a missing person. Amy Williams was pronounced dead only a few days later.
    Her body never being found, but no one would ever believe that she could
    survive such a ferocious firestorm.<br />

    How wrong they all were. <br />

    She escaped, finally free from her family and their hideous influence. She
    then spent the next nine years of her life using her power. She used them
    to steal food and new clothing, maaaaybe taking a few hundred bills with
    her on her way.<br />

    She now goes about doing whatever she pleases for cheap thrills, a cocky
    and childish attitude about her. Occasionally getting into fights with the
    local heroes, always just managing to get away before the coppers could
    show up.
</p>
<p style="color:#f37;">
    <strong>Resources:</strong> An abandoned warehouse she calls home,
    decorated with all her stolen items and pics of both her wins and losses to
    heroes. Along with a few stuffed dummies she uses as target practice every
    now and then.
</p>
<p style="color:#f37;">
    <strong>Equipment:</strong> Fire resistant suit underneath her regular
    clothing.
</p>
<p style="color:#f37;">
    <strong>Skills:</strong> Has an understanding of self-defense martial arts,
    marksmanship with her flames, a little stronger than the everyday human due
    to her activities, and while her powers may not show it, she can be sneaky
    when she wants to be.
</p>
<p style="color:#f37;">
    <strong>Power:</strong> Fire Transformation/Manipulation.<br />

    While normal, fire has no effect on Amy at all. Maybe the smoke, but the
    fire itself is harmless to her. She cannot manipulate or generate any fire
    while normal.<br />

    However, when she actually does use her Magma Form, she is then able to
    generate and slightly manipulate fire of around 450c. Only able to send off
    one wave of fire from the palms of her hands per turn. And her manipulation
    only goes so far as too change the size of the said fire. The fire’s speed
    is around 40mph, losing 10c for every 5 meters away from the flame travels.
    <br />

    Amy can condense the flame into a small ball, and upon collision with an
    object, the ball will explode in a four-meter radius with a knockback
    damage of 8kN. The balls can only be used once, with a cooldown of four
    turns. She can also fire off a concussive wave of fire from her hands, able
    to deal 11kN plus the heat of her fire. She can use her fire waves to
    propel herself into the air, using them as small thrusters to move around
    the area at a speed of 30mph.
</p>
<p style="color:#f37;">
    <strong>Versatility:</strong> Able to use her heat to weld weaker metals
    together, and to roast her up a pretty mean s'more.
</p>
<p style="color:#f37;">
    <strong>Demo:</strong> Amy smirked, letting the flames consume her form as
    ravenous eyes stared at her opponents.<br />

    “It’s just not your lucky day fella!” And with that plus her transformation
    complete, she gave a loud laugh and stuck her right out! A blast of fire
    was sent spiraling towards her opponent! <br />

    And that was that.<br />
