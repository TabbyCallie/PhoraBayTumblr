    Magician (Jack of all Trades/Jack in the Box)</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Age:</strong> 34</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Carefree, absentminded and
    fickle. Jack is a man of happiness, of wonder, and tragic insanity. His
    train of thought is jumbled and chaotic, and he acts as such, only
    concerned with the show of life. He’s a joker, a clown, a jester. </p>

    in his 30’s, dressed usually in his magician garb. Top hat, tuxedo, and
    cape, ridiculous wand. He has wide and curious blue eyes and a partial
    smirk on his tired face. His arms are particularly long and slender. The
    rest of his body is average proportion. </p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>History:</strong> Not much is known of jacks past.
    If he knows something, he isn’t telling. One thing for sure: he’s an
    experienced magician with many skills. </p>

    shows are usually 500 a week with weekend performances or special events,
    and heists. His troupe he’s affiliated with. </p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Extendable wand baton.
    Spring-loaded shoes. A bag of tricks, filled with props such as a water
    hose flower, trick cards, smoke bombs, and handcuffs and ropes. </p>

    pickpocketing,
    fast-talking, illusionism, Mentalism, trickery with charisma. </p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Power:</strong> <u>Fools bluff</u>: Jack has the
    power to distort the air around him, creating illusions and shrouds for his
    tricks and talents to excel. Shrouding, enhancing, evading and creating, he
    can make you see what he wants you to see. <br />

    <u>Range</u>: 50-meter circle around him.<br />

    <u>Area</u>: nothing larger than humans. The faster an illusion moves, the
    more light distortion there is, like heat shimmering. Less movement and
    subtle actions make less of a distortion and disturbance to the light
    spectrum. <br />

    Has no smell or temperature, no tangibility.  They look real unless
    disturbed by strong winds or movement, then they dissipate like smoke. If
    he doesn’t concentrate, the illusion fades. He can only conjure one large
    thing at a time, or two animalistic shapes or smaller. Illusions within a
    2m range of him can have special attributes, like sscent, or audio or
    slight temperature emission, since he can focus clearer due to the
    proximity.</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Versatility:</strong> Jack can use his illusions
    to change a small space around him, mostly for his own trickery and
    cleverness. Small tricks combined with his experience and talent. </p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Demo:</strong> Jack holds a performance. In his
    hands he holds a card, he turns it and changes it to look like a different
    card. Jack distorts himself looking invisible, blending into a background
    while standing still if he were to move, he would give off visible shimmers
    and distortion like hot air.</p>
