<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Mentality:</strong> Cold and ruthless but not a
    psychopath. He isn't afraid to kill but he doesn't kill if unnecessary. He
    lives for himself and cares little what others think of him. He just cares
    about his survival and owns well being. </p>

    side.)</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>History:</strong> N/A</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Resources:</strong> 12k in current currency, owns
    an apartment on 8th floor in the city center. Works as a barber and gets
    2.8k a month.</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Equipment:</strong> None.</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Skills:</strong> Good at acting and getting out
    of sticky situations. Knows few self-defense skills but hasn't ever studied
    any martial art officially. Also is a good dresser.</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Power:</strong> Vector manipulation.<br/>

    Sero can manipulate vectors. He can change the direction of max 5 incoming
    separate vectors completely. Max speed of a Vector he can manipulate is 35
    m/s. Beyond that will be impossible. Upon changing direction, they lose 30%
    of their initial speed. Sero also can slow down any incoming vector by 70%.
    The range of manipulation is 10 m radius. He can also speed up any vector
    that moves in opposite direction from Sero by 50%. Once he has changed the
    direction of 5 vectors his ability goes on 3 turn cooldown.<br />

    <u>Absolute stop</u>: Sero goes in overload mod for 1 turn where he can
    freeze any vector that enters his range no matter how quick it is. After
    that turn is over he goes on 5 turn cooldown.<br />

    <u>Drawback</u>: Sero cannot manipulate any vector he doesn't see so
    attacking his blind spot is the easiest way to win. Also sending more than
    5 different objects at once will overload him and few of those will surely
    go through. He also cannot affect spectral melee weapons.<br />

    <u>Retrieval</u>: Makes up to 3 small portals to retrieve up to 3 items
    that she touched in the last 3 turns. It takes .5 seconds for the portal to
    open and 0.5 seconds for it to become active. If the item hasn't been
    touched in the last 3 turns then she can only make 1 portal and it will
    take double the time to open and become active. This portal won't work if
    someone is holding the item she tries to retrieve or if it is attached to
    something. Cooldown 2 turns.</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Versatility:</strong> He has extremely good
    defense and in some case offense but is lacking mobility.</p>

<p style="color:#93f"><strong>Demo:</strong> 3 thugs attack Sero on the street.
    1 swings a bat at him at full speed so Sero reverses the bat and hits the
    thug in the head. The other one throws a knife at Sero so he changes the
    angle of the knife and directs it into the leg of the third thug. He then
    picks up the bat and throws it towards the second thug while increasing the
    speed by 50%.</p>
