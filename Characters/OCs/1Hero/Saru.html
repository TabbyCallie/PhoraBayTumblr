    <strong>History:</strong> Yamazaru was born to Japanese parents in a small
    village in the mountains of China. His earliest days were recalled by his
    parents, a baby boy that resembled a monkey with fur growing from unusual
    parts of his body. As he grew older his parents found that the resemblance
    didn't stop with just looks, Yamazaru was agiler than any of the other
    kids, faster and stronger. He particularly liked to climb on top of their
    house, where he'd have to be coaxed down by his parents, or play tricks on
    his friends. <br />

    At age 13 Yamazaru was becoming more monkey-like. His parents began to find
    him more unmanageable, his playful behavior often resulted in mischevious
    acts, like taking something that didn't belong to him. His playfulness
    mixed with his above average strength proved difficult to deal with for
    most people, losing his friends that he used to play with through one too
    many injuries.<br />
    One fateful day, Yamazaru ran to town looking for someone to play with. He
    happened upon another kid his age who hesitantly agreed after some
    pestering from Yamazaru. During their game, Yamazaru had broken the child's
    arm by accident and ran home to his parents. The child's parents marched to
    his house and told Yamazaru's parents what he had done. Infuriated with his
    continuously growing unmanageable behavior, his parents contacted a temple,
    on a separate mountain from the village. The monks there took him in after
    inspecting the boy and his semblance to the monkey.<br />

    For 10 years Yamazaru was trained by the monks in combat and virtue. When
    in combat he is more akin to the monkey, absorbing little knowledge of
    their training, but skilled in his own way through his heightened agility,
    this is where he acquired his first bo staff. In a spar with another monk,
    he climbed his own staff that he placed on the ground and leaped off it,
    swinging the staff and breaking it across the monks back, when he landed
    his feet cracked the stone of the training hall. His punishment for this
    was to descend the mountain to gather fresh water in buckets, he had to do
    this enough times to supply every monk. <br />

    The lessons of virtue, however, stuck with Yamazaru. Learning the
    importance of peace, helping others, not to be greedy and he learned to
    follow karma, good things will come through good deeds. With his newfound
    inner peace, Yamazaru set out on his own journey. He wanted to use his
    abilities for good and to help people as much as he could. Finally finding
    his place to settle down, he became a hero and started fighting crime. To
    Yamazaru this was the best good deed he could do, because he got to fight!
