<p style="color:#f43;"><strong>History:</strong> Hiruko just lived a normal
    life with normal and common people as parents and a small house somewhere
    in the middle of the city. Hiruko had a lot of friends and was like a
    feared kid back in the days. His personality which is still the same made
    him very scary. No fear of anyone, hating the weaklings. He wasn't a bully
    though, he was the exact opposite. He helped the one who was bullied. He
    hated stronger ones who obviously just chose the weaklings because they
    were too much of a pussy to fight with people at his height. This attitude
    changed very fast, as he learned how to control his power. The way of
    learning that power and the beginning of this wasn't a happy one.<br />

    He killed his parents at the age of 8. The horrible thing was, that he
    actually knew what he was doing. He wanted to kill his parents, but the
    police didn't know that. They thought it was an accident, but still, it was
    horrible. The few months at the orphanage didn't change a thing because he
    instantly got into a new family. 2 simple parents picked him up and for
    their luck, they never were at home so Hiruko couldn't even kill them. But
    he still got to the point, where he killed over children. Thus killing
    children, he trained his power at already at the age of 10 on a very high
    level. He still hid every child and almost every hint when he killed
    someone. Thus made him a pro at a very young age. Nevertheless, he got
    caught sometimes hurting the children, punching them. He never killed
    someone when someone could find or see him killing someone. That mentality
    was perfect for a serial killer, no? He continued this way of life to the
    age of 16. He left his adopted family and bought a small apartment and
    continued his life by killing overs. The big but is, that he started to
    take on missions of crime and mafia bosses in the underground which also
    gave him the name "One-Eyed Serial Killer." And now his life is going
    on.</p>

<p style="color:#f43;"><strong>Resources:</strong> A little over 20K and a
    small apartment in the city-central.</p>

<p style="color:#f43;"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Ropes - Hiruko always
    carries one or two pairs of ropes with him to restrain his victim.<br />

    Black Mask - Using when he does missions so his face is slightly covered
    (Kaneki's Ghoul Mask)</p>

<p style="color:#f43;"><strong>Skills:</strong> Over 10 years of fighting
    knowledge, without power and with, experienced serial killer, experienced
    mercenary, experienced knife user, high mobility.</p>

<p style="color:#f43;"><strong>Power:</strong> Killer's Mentality<br />

    Hiruko's power is, to create small blood limbs with a width of 1 cm on
    every part of his or other bodies. He activates this body when his left eye
    turns red with a small pupil and black in the background. Those little
    blood limbs can be sharpened, hardened, curved or bend and made longer and
    shorter. needs 12 kN damage to be destroyed and overall have a 2 turn
    cooldown if they get destroyed.<br />

    <u>Mobility</u>:<br />

    Hiruko creates two blood limbs on both or just one biceps. One blood limb
    is inside his skin and one outside. The one outside is sheathed around his
    biceps like a small armband and the one inside "stimulates" his muscles and
    veins to go beyond human power and speed while punching. The same concept
    goes to his legs, just the blood limbs are created around his calves. The
    same thing goes with his torso, but the torso is way more exhausting and
    harder. His punches are 18m/s fast and do 12 kN Damage. His legs can go up
    to a speed of 22m/s and his running speed is 50km/h his kicks do 15 kN
    damage. His torso just gets over human power flexibility. Meaning that he
    can bend his torso 180 degrees total. Maximum of 2 turns.<br />

    <u>Limb Weapon</u>:<br />

    Hiruko can create up to 2 blood limbs everywhere on his body and either
    sharpen, harden or bend them to a certain point. One blood limb has a width
    of 5 mm and can be up to 10 cm to 25 cm high. A sharpened blood limb is as
    sharp as a simple knife. A hardened limb is as hard as concrete. And it can
    be flexed/bent to 90 degrees.<br />

    Hiruko can always bend the blood limbs, but he can only sharpen and harden
    one limb at once. Bending has no cooldown and the other things last 3 turns
    and got a cooldown of 1 turn.<br />

    <u>Torturing/Helping Mentality</u>:<br />

    Hiruko can perform his power on his victims. His and his victim's blood
    need to touch to perform this. If this is done, Hiruko can create a blood
    limb, where the blood from his victim came from. This blood limb is just as
    the blood limbs that Hiruko creates, the only difference is, that the blood
    limbs on his victims to serious damage. They can manipulate the victim's
    blood system and veins and skin when Hiruko made enough contact with the
    blood of the victims wound.</p>
<ul style="color:#f43;">
    <li>0% - 25%: Hiruko can just create the blood limb and sharpen, harden and
        flex it</li>
    <li>25% - 50%: The blood limb can make contact with the vein of the victim,
        but can't do any damage yet. It's just like having a needle in his
        veins when a doctor takes blood from you. Just for a longer period of
        time and no blood is taken.</li>
    <li>50% - 75%: Blood Limb can already move in the blood system but cant do
        any real damage.</li>
    <li>75% - 100%: The blood Limb can now move in the blood system of the
        victim and do serious damage. Needs 1 turn to do damage. The first turn
        causes muscle cramps, the second causes nosebleeds and damage get worse
        until the fifth turn. Normal people pass out at the fifth turn. Over
        human average people at 7th turn. Everything stops when the person
        passes out.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#f43;"><strong>Versatility:</strong> Above.</p>

<p style="color:#f43;"><strong>Demo:</strong> <em>Hiruko just sits on the
    ground, seeing his opponent walking slowly towards him. He stands up and
    begins to do the same as his opponent. His left eye changes and blood limbs
    are forming on his calves.</em><br />

    <em>He sprints towards his opponent, creating a blood limb on his right
    palmm, being 20cm long and sharpened. Hiruko aims at the chest of his
    opponent while dashing past his opponent,</em><br />

    "You can do better." He said as he looked at his opponent who was laying on
    the ground with a clear, long cut on his chest area.</p>
